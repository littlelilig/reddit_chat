That makes no sense to me... unless he was helping the police bulk up their case against Adnan... which is, in and of itself, problematic.

Dave Reisner initially packages systemd for archlinux and back in the early days it was a lot of work to run. You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while. newlinechar  newlinechar What happened was two-fold: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up. newlinechar  newlinechar Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.

Haha I guess I'm just bad at opening boxes. We'll see how the manager handles it.
It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell. 
I don't want anything serious though. As long as you promise 0 emotional attachment.

And I know we're not expected to dress like that, but it still means that if I'm not following those rules, or if I want to wear something because it looks nice, it feels like I'm drawing attention to myself.  I only feel modest in clothing that makes me look like a little girl.

All Jews ignore certain parts of the Torah. The Torah has the death penalty for like every other thing. There are also an enormous number of supporting documents created by important cultural figures and theologians throughout the millennia. Different communities read different texts, interpret different things differently, or simply ignore other things. My suspicion having met many Jews, Christians,  and Muslims in my life is that the moderates don't even read their core texts. Extremists not only read core texts and supporting documents, but they also take traditions in their communities very seriously. Sexual segregation in ultra orthodox communities and face coverings in ultra conservative Muslim communities are examples of traditions, not so much specifically religiously mandated acts.

Right, which I think is really useful to know. But what I've seen happen is people read this and then forget what the cold hard reality is, you are dealing with another human being who hears these kinds of lines all day long, the safest thing you can do is be extremely polite, friendly, and cooperate until you're asked to do something that you're not comfortable with. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I'm going to roll my window all the way down, I'll keep my hands in plain sight.

I think Judaism and Islam are far more similar than Christianity. Christianity took a big old 'left turn' when Paul took it to the Gentiles and its message became Hellenized (mixed with Greek/Roman 'stuff). That 'Trinity' bullshit isn't in Islam nor is Jesus though of as anything more than a prophet. But from what I've read you're absolutely right that early Christianity was around and had an impact on the formation of Islam.

Reaper is probably more flexible than anything for this kind of thing, but for different reasons. Ableton Live and Logic give you tools to get 'under the hood' and play with the routing. Reaper is technically more flexible because it open source. I'm sure some tech-wiz could write you some kind of script for a plugin that would do that in reaper, but reaper is hairier than anything else when it comes to that kind of stuff, and it's pretty intimidating for any daw. Ask around at /r/Reaper or the forums on Cockos' website, but I personally can't help, only point you in the right direction. I can tell you that Pro Tools's software is locked down tight, so it always works the way they want it to. I doubt you'll be able to find anything like that for Pro Tools.

Nice Nice, i finished that last year. First two seasons were good. Kinda dragged out later seasons, but it was satisfying overall. 
Hm alright then. I'll change my comment to 'near-omnipotent beings' then. The only reason I used the term 'omnipotent' is because that's the term that's repeatedly used in the classic Dr. Strange comics I'm reading, to describe beings like Dormammu, Shuma-Gorath and Mephisto and etc (and only when they are inside their own realms are they considered omnipotent). But I guess that's just an exaggeration then.
According to Oxford, either is acceptable. But your way is definitely more aesthetically pleasing, so props.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Graphic Design University, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret branding ops for Fortune 500s, and I have over 300 confirmed logos.

I totally get what you mean in terms of being cautious. There were a few times where I noticed that he put himself in between myself and others until we passed them. For example, we were walking through a parking lot back home (back in our old apartment in Queens), and there were about 5-6 guys standing in the middle talking with each other. He's on an extender leash so he was ahead of me, but I noticed him notice them ahead of us, slowed down until he was in between them and myself, and then when we passed them completely he sped up again. He didn't lunge or bark or do anything differently other than that though, it's only because I'm always paying attention to everything he does that I noticed it. Too bad he doesn't know what officer's uniforms look like, but again - I don't mind him being protective of me. :)

That brings up an interesting question. More likely than not, there are association footballers, track stars, people living in deserted African or Siberian villages who have the potential (numbers and intangibles) to start at some position in the NFL. newlinechar  newlinechar There are 32 starting NFL quarterbacks coming from a pool of 316.1 million. That means that in the US, there is one starting quarterback per  9,878,125 people. There are 7 billion people in the world, or 708 (rounding down) NFL starting caliber guys in the world. Subtract 32 (for those already on NFL rosters) and that's 676 who mathematically could start right now for a franchise. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to find just ONE of those guys before Sunday.

Except it's not about all Hasidics. Fucking read for Christ's sake. The post you responded to mentioned 'people who dress like that' and a specific sect, and you responded with a generalization about Jewish people, considering the post you responded to wasn't about any specific Hasidic section but merely mentioned one. You're so concerned about someone being treated unfairly aligning with your ideology that you're willing to shit on some other group. And I realize that certain Hasidic sects are backwards as hell and deserve criticism for their social policies, but that is almost irrelevant to what I said to you.
Each and every year millions of people wrongly use the term 'I could care less'. The phrase 'I could care less' has become a very common phrase used to express your lack of interest in an aforementioned topic. However, the phrase makes no sense. We, the people of the internet, must fix this! newlinechar  newlinechar Now, by using the phrase 'I could care less,' the point you are trying to make is, on a scale of 0 - 10, that you care absolutely 0. However, if you could care less, you cannot be at 0 caring, as there must be a level below that to care less. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, the correct phrase to express 0 caring is 'I couldn't care less.' If you could not care less, then you are Absolute 0 Caring. You CAN NOT care less than you currently do.

Agreed, that's the point I'm trying to make.  If you say that power is a measure of loudness you have to agree that not only does a 60 dB wave have twice the *power* of a 57 dB wave, but that it's also twice as *loud*.  Of the three metric given (amplitude, power, or dB) decibels is the only one that really makes any sense for a logarithmically perceived quantity. newlinechar  newlinechar This is also true for light, although light is always measures using linear metrics (lux, candelas) it is perceived logarithmically, so 200 lx doesn't look twice as 'bright' as 100 lx. newlinechar  newlinechar Side note- This is why I hate words like 'loud' and 'bright' in technical contexts.

It's literally semantics. :D Synonyms are useless unless they have a slight distinction, after all. But yeah, before accepting a gift the social implications should always be considered.

If they bring you food, you should return the dish with food in it (or a separate dish of food, continuing the cycle!). These things are important! newlinechar  newlinechar The ex is definitely a douche. Leaving someone after that long and so much mutual dependence with so little warning or planning is pretty much unforgivable.

For the same reason she somewhat pities Angel when Tina casts her as a horrendous spider monster that wanted to kill everyone - Claptrap didn't have a choice in the matter. His programming bound him to follow Jack. Installing and uninstalling the VaultHunter.exe protocols, according to Claptrap's origin ECHOs, also screws with Claptrap's memory, so it's possible Clappy doesn't remember even being the Fragtrap. Her whole purpose in interrogating Athena is to see if she feels sorry for what she did. Instead, Athena makes no apologies for the role she played, and that understandably pisses Lilith off. Had she run Claptrap through that same line of questioning, it's unclear if he even would have remembered, so it would've been little more than an exercise in futility. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike Claptrap and Angel, Athena had the option to walk away at any time.

That's an interesting point. Clearly the economic dimension is huge. And if you take France, Gaullism in the 1960's had a definite ethnic tinge. The best way I can think of is to track the differences about Algeria: in the 1960's it was about hanging on to French Algeria, with the National Front it is all about how Algeria was also the good fight (Le Pen senior was a paratrooper).  newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is that a.) the National Front is now distancing itself from that position and b.) Gaullism was also in some vague contradictory sense anti-Fascist, or at least based on the mythology of the French resistance: but that's becoming weaker as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar So there's definitely a continuity of sentiments but the direction and motivation is changing.

&gt; Sure they do. newlinechar  newlinechar No they aren't. Not even light works the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. newlinechar  newlinechar What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.
Fair enough, your average trainer isn't going to be able to tame Rayquaza. However, you're not the average trainer.

I don't believe we do. Child support is designed to make sure a child can be taken care of. So long as giving the child a proper chance at life is an option (which it is through adoption in the US), why would we need to make up for lack of child support? newlinechar  newlinechar Bringing a child into the world is a financial decision. If a woman choses to bring a child into this world knowing she will have no financial help and happens to fail to provide proper support for the child (whether she knew she would not be able to or she simply falls down on her luck), why should she not be punished for it? If you try and buy a house but fall short on payment, the reason behind your lack of payments doesn't change that fact that the house gets taken away. Why would a child be different? No matter the reason, if you are unable to support a child (and need to rely on a secondary funding source to do so), why should there not be consequence for taking the money?

That's not a criticism, as you're trying to do the right thing in being modest.  That's a good thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty newlinechar  newlinechar Nope.  You have your body, given to you by God.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest newlinechar  newlinechar That's on them, *not you*.

Do you have any Catholic women that you can talk to in person about this issue?  Perhaps talking to your priest would also help. newlinechar  newlinechar --------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar You can also look into classic clothing.  Those outfit basics that don't go out of style.  Right now if I were a woman I'd probably not be seen outside without a cable knit sweater and jeans (we guys have it so much easier in this area).  100% coverage, 100% comfy.  Button up blouses go pretty much year round.  So do slacks.  Swap out your accessories and you can somewhat keep up with fashion so you don't look 'young' or dated. newlinechar  newlinechar There are cool places out there (Edit: PM for a specific recommendation, didn't think about the rules for a sec) that not only offer some cool current and retro dresses and separates, but they also tailor it to your dimensions for a reasonable fee.  My wife loves these dresses--modest and cute as well as retro.

There's no such thing as preemptively abdicating, so I assume you're joking. newlinechar  newlinechar But there are people who think that Charles should basically decide not to become King in order to let William become King. Either by refusing the crown or abdicating like his great-uncle did. I just seriously doubt that's going to happen. Charles has lived his entire life expecting to become King one day. Don't think he's going to give it up. It's not like him accepting the crown means William won't become King. Obviously, William should out-live Charles and will eventually become King. newlinechar  newlinechar Gotta feel a little sorry for the second sons (Andrew and Harry). The pro is that they get to live like a royal, but with none of the responsibility or spotlight of being the first born. The con is that you live your entire life knowing that your only purpose is to be a spare just in case your brother dies before having kids. Then, once he has kids, you are truly superfluous. Andrew went from having like a 10% chance of one day becoming king to having approximately 0% chance on the day that William was born.

With each charge cycle, the batteries wear increasing the internal resistance of the cell just a bit. Marrying a pair of batteries so that they wear evenly over time ensures that you don't have one more worn than the other, which if you're lucky will shorten the cell's lifespan and could lead to venting because one is working harder to keep up with the other. It's also a good idea in a serial setup (like the hexohm v2) to switch the batteries in the sled each cycle (a on left one cycle, on right the next) although this is less important than having a married pair (depending on who you ask). 
Right. But if the marbles instead go down in value, say to 50 cents for 100 marbles, you've lost 50% of your cash value. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, it may be significantly more valuable or significantly less valuable or exactly as valuable compared to when you bought it. The reason for this is as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows speculators are trying to guess how much each bitcoin is worth and going to be worth, and those guesses change dramatically each week.

Ehhhh. A little bit of the manifesto and what other commies have rehashed to me. It has helped with understanding economics a little better, but that just made me lean towards syndicalism. Sure capitalism allows for people to get lucky and never have to do anything productive for the rest of their lives, but socialism has this miserable taboo that is so embedded in some cultures we may as well give up trying to preach it. Syndicates have been shown to work the most effectively for the most people in real life. But there's still thus competitive atmosphere that I see is necessary, but it's not exactly morally fulfilling. I think it's more a problem with people thah politics.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar

I'm not a structural engineer, so I can't give you generalisable answers. You can see before the reno the load bearing beam was below the joists in the opening that existed between these two rooms - probably because it was cheaper and easier to install in this configuration.  newlinechar  newlinechar No, you sacrifice no strength - the joist span is identical in both cases. As long as the ends of the beam are properly supported, and the beam is appropriately dimensioned and compositioned for this job (OP used an LVL beam), everything is the same as if there was a studded wall there.  newlinechar  newlinechar This may not be possible with a second story. The height of the beam is what gives it its strength. There may not be space between stories to install an appropriate beam for the span. Using a steal I-beam can often work. Also, both ends need to be supported with their own footing. OP's house is build on-slab, so its this isn't really an issue.

I've taken the test. It is extremely easy to tell the difference between 64 tick and 128 tick servers. There is far more movement stutter on 64 tick servers. When an enemy is running across my screen, it is far easier to hit and kill them on 128 tick. Movement on my end feels noticeably different too. Hitting 2-3 bunny hops on 128 tick is a cakewalk. Stringing hops together on 64 tick is all about luck.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't choose anything. Societies don't make two or three-way choices at pivotal moments. History isn't actually like EU4 or something. They had a small ownership ownership class, which benefitted greatly, and the rest of it was just dragged along in this inefficient, shitty mess. That's how commodity economies work. A small group of owners owns them and utilizes them, and they get wealthy while nothing else happens economically.

Crowding the referee is more common in football than other sports because a single decision can completely change the game. Things like red cards and penalties can easily decide the match. There's also no challenge system like in other sports, so decisions don't simply get reversed. It can also affect later decisions in the same match if the referee feels pressured to maybe even something out.

Also helps against counterfeiting. A smaller value banknote cannot be changed to look like a higher value note. In the US it was (maybe still is?) possible to 'bleach' a one dollar note and print a 50 using the bleached paper to get the right feel. You can't do this with euro notes.

I also suspect some games with servers not on Xbox live cloud, may be using ports not used by Xbox live so the console is not configuring the router with UPnP correctly for the game.

The router and LAN config is the variable.

I really doubt that, and that would be a longshot based on his  shallow understanding of Anna. He really didn't knew her for more than a day, so killing Elsa on his party was to risk everything based on a supposition over the girl.

'Now it’s clear that hyperglycemia (HG) alone or combined with hypercholesterolemia has synergistic toxic effects on the survival and function of stem cells' - Why is this important? Because stem cells are established to be reparative to vessels, which prevents arteriosclerosis (Yes, you know this - the one that causes CHD, IHD, sudden heart attacks, decreased blood flow, etc.). newlinechar  newlinechar But what if it is the hypercholesterolemia that causes the toxic effects on stem cells? 'Increased dietary carbohydrates, particularly simple sugars and starches with high glycemic index, can increase levels of small, dense LDL and HDL'. Even then, carbohydrates increase the rates of LDL, which we all know as a major factor in the production of cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no surprise that a diet low in simple sugars (besides fructose) and meat has been proven to be most healthy. That is the way our body has developed for tens of thousands of years of evolution.  newlinechar  newlinechar In order for a study to be done on low-carb diets accurately, it must either measure the effects of a diet where most of the protein comes from vegetable sources, or one where most come from animal sources. In this study, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506174), 'reductions in LDL-C concentration and total cholesterol-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B-apolipoprotein AI ratios were greater for the low-carbohydrate compared with the high-carbohydrate diet'. In this case, the low-carb diet got its protein from vegetable sources, a diet recognized to be very natural for our body. Most of the hate from 'clean' diets comes from the fact that not all low-carb diets actually do what they claim. We know that 'Low-carbohydrate, high-animal protein diets, which are advocated for weight loss, may not promote the desired reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration', but that is just indicative of the well-known fact that animal protein is not very healthy for us, most significantly when consume in excess. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottom line - eating healthy means eating less (something I didn't touch on, but is very important), and and eating a low-carb diet that is low on meat. These types of diets have been shown to decrease chances of diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer to diabetes.

My husband decided to become a reverend, and as a result is going to school full time. Combine that with a poor-ish childhood and you create a person like me: frugal and concerned with saving money.  newlinechar  newlinechar There were some extremely lean years, and I started working at 15. I have put myself in situations that were less than safe due to lack of funds and no choice (buses and CTA through bad neighborhoods, broken down car in bad areas, putting up with sexual harassment at work because I needed the money, etc) and after having a kid, I realized I never wanted her in those situations.  newlinechar  newlinechar I get my inspiration from Mormon housewife blogs and Pinterest, mostly. I know Mormons are not well-liked on the internet, but those ladies have to present themselves In a certain way, have a bunch of kids (typically), can't really work outside the home, and need to make a dollar stretch. They give some darn good tips. (I should add that we are not Mormon, but still, the money saving tips are great!)  newlinechar  newlinechar I remind myself that any dollar I don't need to spend is a dollar my kid doesn't need to earn later in life. That stops me from spending money I don't need to spend.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We are in the process of moving now, from a really expensive extremely rich neighborhood, to a middle class one. We will be selling our condo, and for half the price, buying a two bedroom home. I make a good living, but at work, I'm the person who is always willing to help,  always willing to go the extra mile, and as a result, in a position to say 'I saved company $13m in 2013, can I have a 10% raise?' When you put it that way, and can verify it, they have a hard time saying no.  newlinechar  newlinechar I work as a female in a male dominated industry (like 99.8% male) and therefore NO ONE NOTICES WHAT I WEAR. Hence the capsule wardrobe.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another blog I read for inspiration is olgasflavorfactory.com. She has lessons from her immigrant parents on there.

Even putting aside this point, it's perfectly legal to show **pretty much anything in a movie**, since it's something that a studio can decide to release or not release, a theater can choose to exhibit or not exhibit, and a movie goer can decide to go see or not see.  newlinechar  newlinechar Broadcast television is a limited public space (there is only so much broadcast bandwidth available), and so it was decided that broadcasts in this public space should be subject to public regulation (the Federal Communication Commission).

&gt;So this was intended as a bit of a trap newlinechar  newlinechar Well [of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA)  Isn't that the whole idea? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If animals are ~30% as mentally capable as humans should we eat, cage, etc them? newlinechar  newlinechar Definitely. Though I'd put it at closer to 1%.  I'd also consider it a 'threshold' situation and not a linear one, so an animal with 30% of our intelligence doesn't deserve 30% of our moral consideration; it deserves 0% until it deserves 100%. And IMO the only reasonable line for that cut-off is: they're smart enough to meaningfully participate in the Social Contract. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Would you do that to a mentally handicapped person  newlinechar  newlinechar That's an interesting case to consider. Historically the argument has been made both ways. Personally, I consider this pragmatically: it's just not practical to have our moral/legal duties depend on qualities that are not superficially evident (imagine arguing with a cop that the person you just shot had an IQ of 59 and not 60 and therefore wasn't a person). The only unambiguous 'bright line' is human/animal. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;how do you feel about utilitarianism newlinechar  newlinechar I like the fact that utilitarians value ends over means. I dislike the fact that they quibble about nonsense like 'well-being' or 'happiness'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;don't you feel that in some way by being a vegan/vegetarian with the world in its current state that one is helping out newlinechar  newlinechar Abso-fucking-lutely not. See my point about population control. I really believe that. I also believe that people a) are incapable of individually affecting the behavior of markets and b) even if they could, it would distort the price-signals that markets provide, ultimately resulting in a suboptimal misallocation of resources.

Before Mad Cow was clearly identified the Cows in pastures would go crazy essentially and stop being able to function, they'd find a dead cow and take it to the meal grinder (thinking nothing of it) then a few more cows would die, they'd do the same thing.

No problem. It's easy to miss obvious stuff.  newlinechar  newlinechar FYI, you might wanna change your flair to 'Cis' or 'Cisgender' instead of 'Born'. Some people hold the view that trans people *are* born their gender, and claiming that your physical configuration at birth is all that matters can be transphobic (ie, trans guys aren't really guys because they weren't 'born male'). Cis is better because all it means is your physical configuration at birth and your gender identity have always matched.

Saying that we can't rule something out 'just because there is no evidence' is illogical. That is what the entire judicial system is built upon: evidence. Sometimes it's hard DNA evidence, sometimes it's circumstantial evidence, but *some kind* of evidence is the starting point. There has never been any credible motive given for Jay killing Hae, nevermind a mystery third person, so how you can see that as just as plausible as Adnan being involved (with all the circumstantial evidence I presented to you) is beyond me.... newlinechar  newlinechar You are correct that one person saying it doesn't make it so, which is why I mentioned the students and police officer who testified he asked Hae for a ride, and why I mentioned the Leakin Park pings that contradicts Adnan's assertion he was at the mosque, and the Nisha Call, which Nisha confirms, and the note that says 'I am going to kill.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand how you or anyone can shrug off all of the things I presented as a lack of evidence...

In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Using strong passwords lowers overall [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) of a security breach, but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective [security controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_controls). The effectiveness of a password of a given strength is strongly determined by the design and implementation of the [factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Factors_and_identity) (knowledge, ownership, inherence). The first factor is the main focus in this article. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g. three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secured with relatively simple passwords. However the system must store information about the user passwords in some form and if that information is stolen, say by breaching system security, the user passwords can be at risk. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar ^Interesting: [^L0phtCrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0phtCrack) ^| [^Password ^length ^parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_length_parameter) ^| [^Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password) ^| [^Dictionary ^attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)  newlinechar  newlinechar ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnata7r) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnata7r)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

I'm not sure I agree that there isn't proof.  You can see that the person is approaching the road.  You have testimony of the person whose car was damaged.  The damage to the car can be shown.  There may have even been a shoe print remaining or some similar physical evidence.  The sound indicates something hit the car.  The video shows the person is there and correlates his presence to the side of the damaged car and the sound.   newlinechar  newlinechar The question is whether it's more likely the car was damage beforehand AND this person did not hit the car or (in my mind most likely) that the person did in fact damage the car as claimed.  If the officer followed up diligently there could potentially be evidence from that as well.  I would imagine if this went to a trial, there is a reasonable chance of winning.

They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive).

The numbers located along the green lines connecting the stars are an indication of distance in light years between them. The maximum distance the connections are displayed is 10.0 light years, which is a convention for hyperspace travel.  newlinechar  newlinechar Since a vessel even with the best of calculations will drift due to gravitational forces, the usual maximum range for a safe hyperspace jump is 10 light years. After this point a vessel must return to normal space, recalibrate the hyperdrive, recharge the capacitors, and calculate a new course to continue to a farther destination. Remaining in hyperspace beyond the 10 light year limit can divert a vessel dangerously off course, in addition to the strain of hyperspace upon the drives resulting in malfunctions which render them inoperable. For this reason most hyperspace travel is conducted directly between star systems, using them as waypoints to reach farther targets while stopping to refuel and resupply. Fleets often arrive dispersed over several hundreds of kilometers from gravitational effects, as each ship jumps individually. newlinechar  newlinechar Thus the green lines of distance are also an indication of the routes that hyperdrive vessels take when travelling.

If DMo expects to be paid after his contract is up next year though, I bet he does it. But if you can have DMo for half the price, I think you stick with that no? And you have to consider how DMo is part of the reason that defense is so solid. 
You are truly a noble goat

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I do Ft. Worth more than Dallas, and really I'm from Arlington so I was more hoping to point you in the direction of things to do near the stadium unfortunately. I'd say that you if you're close to Ft. Worth, Ol South Pancake house for breakfast, and Velvet Taco for a fourth meal are good places to eat that aren't expensive at all since it sounds like you're getting gouged on prices everywhere else. Velvet Taco is also very near the bar scene and is open until 3 on weekends so you can hit it up with a nice buzz going no problem. Torchy's Tacos may be better, but they does not stay open as late. If you're into sushi, Blue Sushi is immaculate, but a bit pricey.  Hopefully we can get some Horned Frogs in this thread to give you some good BBQ places to go while you're here in Texas. I would also put in a personal recommendation for Kincaid's Burgers, the one on Camp Bowie. I know a lot of people have their own burger places in Ft. Worth, but Kincaid's is mine. newlinechar  newlinechar Near the stadium, BFF bar and grill if you like chinese, vietnamese, or japanese has like 50 beers on tap from mainly Texas Craft brewers. Then there's Grease Monkey, which is really good burgers and a decent beer selection with live music often. Babe's Chicken, the Arlington location is not the original, but is still a good style. Beware though, all they have is chicken and fried catfish with buffet style sides. Even closer to the stadium, and a good tip for parking, is Lincoln Square Shopping Center. Back in September they were still running a policy where you can spend $40 at any of their shops and park there during the game for free. You can look up a list of restaurants in the center [here.](http://www.lincolnsquarearlington.com/dine) newlinechar  newlinechar  If you want cheap beers on tap, and cheap bar food that isn't bad, No Frills Grill in Arlington on Little Road does 3.69 Pints of some of the best beer you can find in the city. They even carry DeSchutes on tap. It's a bit of dive, but the food and beer is as cheap as you can find for bar food. It's pretty far from the stadium though. There other locations do not have anywhere near the selection though on tap, so I can't speak for those. It's about 30 minutes from cowboys stadium though. newlinechar  newlinechar  I'll keep thinking, and report back, as there are a lot of things to do in DFW.

I had the sleeve gastrectomy on Feb.18th. I used to weigh 324 pounds in 2012 but by the end of last year managed to get down to 270 on my own. I just couldn't do it on my own anymore and decided to do the surgery. newlinechar  newlinechar No, 40 pounds isn't much, and that's because even with the smaller stomach I was binging and comfort eating. I realize how extremely dangerous this is. I could have ruptured the staple line. But that's what BED will do to you. I really needed help and am getting help. Also, psychologically  I'm finally adjusting to eating less food. So things are going a lot better. I'm also exercising every day. newlinechar  newlinechar My surgeon would like to see me at 170 pounds. At this point, I'd be grateful to get under 200. When I get to 170 I'll decide if I want to lose anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar My recovery after the surgery was very simple. I was up and walking around the first day. Since I'm still so heavy I still have a lot of joint and back pain and get tired easily. I'm sure that will improve as the weight continues to come off. newlinechar  newlinechar Give yourself time! My surgeon told me 1 pound a week was realistic. Also, you may not lose weight again for weeks. Give your body some time to adjust.  newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing is to address the BED. If you are anything like me you will want to comfort eat and binge even after the surgery. Eventually, you will get hungry again and you're really going to have to fight the drive to overeat. Like I said, it's taken me nearly a year. This is the biggest psychological transition I have ever made in my life. Hell, I even messed up today when I ate a whole tuna sandwich. I felt like I was going to explode. I should have eaten half. It takes time to learn these lessons! newlinechar  newlinechar I wish you all the best with whatever you choose to do :)
They are. The current status is that it's in limited beta test. No idea how good it is... As far as I heard it's heavily cloud based.
I hate to be 'that guy' but the game simply cannot be balanced around low ranks. Think about it, how much of an issue was the CZ at your rank? When I played on my smurf it was never an issue, but anything above the AK ranks and it was completely absurd. People would switch from their M4 to their CZ to retake a site because of the 1-tap against helmets. If we balanced the game for Novas, it would never have been changed. Long bomb timers make rotating far too easy and honestly make the maps even more CT sided because they can really take their time with retakes. Also having any differences between the highest tier of matchmaking and the absolute lowest tier of these leagues is a bad thing. It's the same reason Valve stopped updating the '_se' maps, splitting up what the matchmaking community does and what pro player do make 'going pro' that much harder.

I last worked on the game about 3.5-4 years ago so I can't speak to what's been going on since, though I do know it is in pure maintenance mode - minimum staff, simply put out content and sustain itself. newlinechar  newlinechar Before that point, we on the team always wanted to put in game rune management in and it was being worked on at several points.  However, a lot of our resources were redirected into other projects such as some really ill-advised facebook games and integration with SOE's game launcher portal so it never completed, and the closing of our studio put an end to that.  The tutorial and new user experience was another area we were always trying to improve, but the will from management simply wasn't there to fund it after the first pass (the full game revamp of UI/simplification of mechanics done in 2009-2010 which included a new tutorial and new starter decks) failed to produce any improvements in our numbers.  Resolutions were a tricky spot - the initial engine for the game, as you might imagine for a game made in java by a mobile game company in the early 2000s, was not very easy to work with.  It was harder to fix than it looked according to our engineers, and there was never any real impetus from leadership to get it done. newlinechar  newlinechar Really the story of Poxnora is defined by the poor return on the marketing spend by SOE.  A lot of money was spent on advertising in really questionable places early on after the acquisition (such as sports and news websites), and after that failed the confidence of management in the game just slowly decayed away.  Generally developers are aware of the problems with their game (I was a hardcore player and addict of Poxnora for 2 years before I worked on it, and was always involved in the community) but unfortunately they don't always get to make the decisions.

To elaborate on this a little bit, natural movement is very complex.

In theory, yes. In practice, not likely. To my knowledge of the different types of 3d printing I'm familiar with, none of them are able to utilize polymerization in the manufacturing.  newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, there would still be a lot of unreacted monomer stuck in the polymer matrix. Typically with nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 you can 'wash' out the caprolactam with boiling water or water vapor or other polar solvents like methanol, but most of the moneymaking for polyamides are in hot melt processing, after the macromolecule has been formed and frozen solid. newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, if the poly being used reacts at a high temperature, you could in theory use a laser or set of lasers to raise the temperature in a small portion of a solution to polymerize and build from there. One form of additive manufacting does exactly this, only by melting bits of a bed of powdered metal.

Your argument is totally valid. But I feel you're putting too much stock into the relevance of 'size'. Size was never the issue, popularity was.  newlinechar  newlinechar Netflix was getting money that the ISPs wanted a piece of, nothing more. It wasn't about the bandwidth they were using, both sides (Client and users) are paying for the bandwidth when they pay their monthly connection fees. But those connection fees are a fixed price, how much you use it or what you use it for doesn't change the cost. The ISPs want a piece of Netflix's pie. newlinechar  newlinechar LoL is one of, if not the, most popular games in the world. I would be very very shocked if the isps aren't doing anything to get a piece of that also.

Have no idea yet! I'll find out tomorrow when I go play ball.
I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema. newlinechar  newlinechar But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises). newlinechar  newlinechar I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

Well yeah they're dead, but I was trying to remind people that by drinking and driving you can hurt or kill yourself and others. 
I've been depressed for over 15 years. Nothing has happened so far that has made the past 15 years worth living. If I had killed myself then, I haven't experienced anything that would have been a loss. I've had some good memories, sure, but nothing that has made the unhappiness worth experiencing.  newlinechar  newlinechar It *can* get better, sure. But it most likely won't. To a depressed person, hearing 'It could be better' is the same as hearing, 'You could win the lottery!' For many, depression is a permanent mental illness. It can be treated but it isn't unusual to go through your entire life vaguely feeling as though killing yourself would be the best option. Look at Robin Williams, for instance. He had been getting treatment for over 40 years, but in the end it never went away and he got tired of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you feel that those who commit suicide are quitters, fine. I don't police peoples' opinions. I just want you to know what you're expecting these people to try to live through. Depression you experience for a short period of time is completely different from depression that lasts a long time and is relentless. I can see why a transsexual teenager living with fundie parents gave in.

What the Jews have done to piss off people in history newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Be different newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Continue to be different newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they (or we, since I'm Jewish) have been persecuted across the globe for the better part of forever speaks more to intolerance for religious and ethnic diversity than some evil plot by the money grubbing Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, Hitler's complaint about the Jews involved them being parasites in Germany and thus keeping down the ethnically superior Aryan race (which was a horrible misinterpretation of anthropology itself). This mostly arose from the Jewish influence on Weimar Germany, which had become a center for liberalism in the arts since the fall of the German Empire. The only thing the Jews did wrong was paint and write novels that were risqué and not traditionally German in the way Hitler saw Germanic culture. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Hitler going a 'little overkill.' You do realize that he systematically murdered 11 million people for no reason other than pure unadulterated racism, right? There is a big gap between accepting Jews and forcing them into ghettos like most of Europe had done. There is a canyon or two between ghettos and genocide. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I love this.

Yeah, I've heard this same thing from a lot of different sources. Ridiculous that a burglar would have grounds to file such a suit, but not at all surprising that there's a lawyer slimy enough to take the case, sadly.

Do you know that the end of that saying is 'IF YOU WANT TO KEEP LIVING IN YOUR SEDAN!'? newlinechar  newlinechar I feel like when people hear the first part, it sounds like you should learn to be independent and not easily manipulated by simple phrases.

Yeah it's invasion of privacy and identity theft pretty much. That would be the same thing as him walking to your mail box and going through it-that's illegal because it's private things going to you, and addressed to you, not him.

How is the noise on the R210 II and is it worth the $600 on ebay? I'm looking at building a new VMServer for my home lab. While I want to go rack I am thinking most likely I will be reusing a tower.

&gt; Well there's a reason mainstream is mainstream and ug is ug. newlinechar  newlinechar True, but that reason is NOT quality newlinechar  newlinechar All I'm saying people's time would be better spent listening to something (doesn't even have to be from 2014) they've never heard before than complaining that Kanye, Kendrick or Chance didn't release anything. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Its pretty hard to say it was a good year for hip-hop when most of majority of most peoples favorite artists didnt come out with anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe, but we're arguing quality here, and in my opinion, ignoring the lines that designate mainstream from ug, there was plenty shit that I consider quality, even compared to last year.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is ALL my opinion though
Also 9) What previous business experience do you have? Did you ever make a similar product? Did you ever work at a job in the same industry? newlinechar  newlinechar Because a lot of times people make a kickstarter about something they have zero experience with. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck with your project which I'm sure is truly great!

Again. He really isn't complaining. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I see it is that a phone developer is weeks behind independent developers. Which means they started late, and haven't incorporated public changes and fixes to the issues they point out.  newlinechar  newlinechar They received source 60 or so days ago. Why are there still bugs, why is this still in alpha phase, for things that have been publicly fixed for weeks?  newlinechar  newlinechar I am running a custom cm12 build with none of those alpha issues. They existed in the past. No more. Why isn't opo implementing those fixes?
TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though. newlinechar  newlinechar Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

OP played as Eden and started with Ball of Bandages. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar He also started with Book of Revelations, guaranteeing a horseman fight on each floor. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar Horsemen always drop a Cube of Meat or Ball of Bandages. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar Getting four Cubes of Meat or Ball of Bandages are both achievements that are hard to get. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar There are only four floor sets that horsemen can appear on, making getting more than four Cubes of Meat or Ball of bandages usually impossible. 
It's a great game, and I love the story, but the gameplay itself is imo very dated. I don't especially like how combat feels, particularly with the 'overheating system,' and I don't know that I've ever met anyone that feels that the combat from original was the best. Combat (one of the biggest components of gameplay) drastically improved over the course of the series. newlinechar  newlinechar The inventory management is horrendous, with an unimaginably clunky UI and dozens of items that have little use other than converting to omingel. What was omnigel for? Why, bypassing the tedious minigames that they eventually ditched entirely. Don't get me wrong, at first I really liked the minigames. But you know what? I didn't miss them when they were removed. And further, when I have gone back and done full playthroughs since then (about four or five) the minigames seem frankly tedious. They don't really add anything unless you really like tedium. newlinechar  newlinechar The faster, refined, tight gameplay/combat from the later games was, I think, a huge step up overall. I do decry the shrinking open world elements later on in the series. But anytime I do a full playthrough I think, 'Ok, fine, lets get through ME1 so I can get to 2 relatively quickly.' newlinechar  newlinechar And if you're opinion differs, that's fine. But I was responding to someone who had trouble getting into ME1. And if that's the case, there's a good chance they'll be like me and they'll find ME2 a breath of fresh air after the somewhat plodding manner of ME1. newlinechar  newlinechar ME1 had some great moments, but for me, and I'm sure others like me, it's my least fun to play because of dated game systems that have since then been very reasonably phased out. newlinechar  newlinechar

I could definitely use more coursework. I've taken applied linear algebra, applied linear regression and have worked my way through about half of Boyd's Convex Optimization book.

According to OP's original post: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My Ndad wasn't always an N. Growing up he was the best father anyone could ask for.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My dads narcissism slowly emerged in the years following his accidents. It began with severe mood swings and paranoia, which eventually evolved into fantasies of self-importance and a desire for complete control of the entire family. newlinechar  newlinechar This is consistent with degenerative brain disease triggered by traumatic brain injury.  I really feel sorry for him AND his family.  He was doing his job and suffered traumatic brain injuries, and he was just left to disintegrate, destroying his own life and his family's lives.   newlinechar  newlinechar Our legal system is a total mess when it comes to severe mental illness, insisting on treating obvious symptoms of mental illness beyond the person's control as 'exercising their freedom', and insisting that the law can't interfere with their 'rights' to 'freedom'.  And then after they kill or permanently maim one or more people (or dozens, as in the cases of Adam Lanza and Seung-Hui Cho), it seems like the whole country starts another round of wailing about how their needs to be more funding for mental health 'treatment', completely ignoring the fact that these people routinely refuse treatment, and the law doesn't allow them to be forced until *after* severe, irreparable harm has been done.
How about I post my responses in the way I see fit - since someone who sees things as simply 100% needs a little clarification in their life.  newlinechar  newlinechar I used to get my fix from [CIR](http://cironline.org/), though I admittedly haven't listened to them in awhile. Their works vary - some is more Serial-esque while others stayed 'just the facts ma'am.  newlinechar  newlinechar Awhile back I was listening to True Murder as well. The difference here is that the podcast is just a forum to interview crime writers. So basically, you're getting the writer injecting his thoughts via the JO's show. It'd be like if someone (let's say you at your station) interviewed Koenig about Serial. Lots of self-injection though. newlinechar  newlinechar I worked at ProPublica for a bit and this method was actually getting quite popular for presentation - though it was less investigative and more presentation of facts/figures/policy.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ultimately I think you and I are going to need to agree to disagree. I really didn't see SK as a center of the piece. I agree with what you said about the abnormal nature of the podcast - but given my discussions with work associates, we felt she made it very clear where she was being personal vs. when she wasn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's New Years Eve, and I have no desire to spend it arguing in circles with someone who basically just disagrees with me on something that can't be confirmed, so I'll go with this: Serial is different, I'll grant you. We hear a lot from SK and I suspect a good part of that has to do with its TAL roots as well as the length of the format. But I would also point out there's a world of difference between Serial and the 3-part Jay interview and the decorum in which the two presenters handled the information. I asked you to see the difference earlier and you can't...not much else I can do for you. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy New Year.

The difficulty with any Japanese names with an R is that you are either going to bastardize the pronunciation into an English hard-R or you are going to have an name no one can pronounce correctly. I'd recommend OP avoid Japanese names with R.
I disagree with none of that. Although honestly, I always thought the idea was spectacularly subjective anyway. Even if we did call it 'best QB', everyone has different ideas of what qualities are important or unimportant anyway. Thing is, sports people usually want to distill everything into a straight 1-2-3-4 progression of 'superiority' even if it doesn't really make sense in the apples compared to oranges world of the NFL.

I feel like Netflix series fit street level heroes better than normal films. They don't require as many special effects and they also have a longer amount of time to develop the characters. newlinechar  newlinechar If the MCU does get ahold of Spidey, it would be interesting to get a Netflix series instead of an actual film for him. Or-- if the costs to show Spidey's powers are too high, a Netflix cartoon series? But not one designed for kids or to sell toys, a more mature one.

I'm a huge CoD fan but I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy Black Ops 2 but loved the first. The way they have the series set up right now, I think Sledgehammer will be in charge of futuristic games or have an Advanced Warfare trilogy. Infinity Ward will have the Ghosts series and will be in charge of any present day games. And then Treyarch will be in charge of WW2, Vietnam War, Cold War ect. That's what would make the most sense to me. I can't see them releasing 3 modern shooters every year especially with Battlefield branching off into different styles of games with Hardline.

How many people do you know that buy full art basics despite the fact that those offer no advantage over regular basics? newlinechar  newlinechar EDH is all about the feel of the cards, or at least the feel of the cards has a much bigger part than it does in other formats.

There's just too much uncertainty involved. You might be able to say that certain types of writing were *generally* to be taken literally, but that won't get you specifics when it comes to each passage. On top of that, each individual writer would bring his own set of beliefs. And even further, we aren't certain about what was changed and how accurate of a representation the current writing is compared to the original. It's also been translated. In many cases the story was an oral tradition for a while before it was written down. And in other cases, we already flat out know that some of the text has been changed, and we have no way of knowing what the original was. newlinechar  newlinechar We can barely have any certainty about the true nature of a single hydrogen atom, and you believe we can be reasonably certain about God's intentions for us as transcribed through a group of ancient writers?

Can confirm. Was at the premiere in Cannes. After the movie when we gave it a standing ovation, Schultz was in tears. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I just need to say, though, that I honestly think the homoeroticism is something that I think critics are reading way too much into. When I saw the movie, I never ever thought there was any homosexual nature in the relationship between du Pont and Schultz. I always got the creepy factor to be from the main theme of the film being how little the rich look at the poor. In fact, I think sexualizing their relationship REALLY undercuts that major point of the movie.

[Late Game Range](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166115821) newlinechar  newlinechar [Mercenary Army Expanded](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238025208) newlinechar  newlinechar [No Maintenance Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288622792) - I think that's the link, not sure. If it doesn't work for you I could just pop up the relevant mod files on Dropbox or something, let me know. newlinechar  newlinechar Along the same lines, I can mention a few more mods I like (not necessarily the names, but what they do): newlinechar  newlinechar * Cheaper Workboats - I really hate how prohibitively expensive workboats are for how finite they are compared to land workers that can stick around forever, and that mod makes them like ~90 gold or just a small amount of production, either being built in one turn in most cities or a few turns in a younger city. newlinechar  newlinechar * All Scouts get the Shoshone Ancient Ruin Bonus - I think that's an incredibly powerful bonus for allowing you to quickly get a free tech or go straight to no terrain penalty archers and composite bows (even potentially getting free techs in the late game if some ruins are still around), so I think it's fairer to make every civ's scout be able to do it. The barbarian encampment and map of surrounding area ruins are totally worthless IMO and this mod incentivizes always using scouts for ruins if you can to pick something better than that garbage. You can still pick up ruins with other units but lose the ability to choose, and I think that's an interesting strategic decision whether you always keep around scouts for that or just use your starting warrior or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar * Separate Great People Counters - This is probably a fairly well known mod but it means you don't have to min-max your great scientist and great engineer points anymore. You just get more great people over the course of the game, allowing you to use them in potentially interesting ways, and great merchants are no longer a pain in the ass but rather something you can plant or pop. newlinechar  newlinechar * Fixed Great Prophets - Prophets spawn as soon as you hit the faith threshold pre-Industrial era instead of it being a random chance. I think the random chance is completely garbage game design and this mod fixes that. Highly recommended. newlinechar  newlinechar * All Siege Units Indirect Fire - I think it's very weird how only a fairly limited amount of siege units get indirect fire so this mod changes that. Makes some earlier siege units nicer when you can have a melee unit as a spotter or whatever rather than having to put the siege unit potentially in harm's way by being adjacent to a city with a melee garrison or something. newlinechar  newlinechar * Faster cultural border expansion - I think the Tradition opener is just too good for this, so it means non-Tradition AI has a chance at decent tile expansion, and Tradition empires will expand quite far to reduce holes in borders and stuff and just generally control more area even if they can't necessarily work it. Can also prevent you from having to use a great general to get a strategic resource just outside of the workable range, which is nice. The mod was actually still too slow for my taste so I reduced border expands to 1/3 the normal cultural cost, and I feel it works well, though of course with like EUI it will spam cultural border notifications eventually. newlinechar

Sugar is the biological killer, not fat (though high fat, and high protein can also be bad in different ways). Simple carbohydrates are bad for 1) Usually low micronutrient value (vitamins/minerals) and 2) simple carbohydrates raise your blood glucose much more than complex carbohydrates.   newlinechar  newlinechar There is obviously a lot more to it, actual bio/chemical science, but this is the basic principle. http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/carbs.html http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html   newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of things can cause diabetes. Poor diet is the main contributor, lack of exercise is another.

Cancer and diabetes are probably the most problematic. newlinechar  newlinechar **note** Some aspects of medical science, including dietary science, are kind of a crap in shoot.

A discussion of the magic, wonder, and horrors of dates, time zones, and UTC, are probably outside the bounds of what would be useful for this subreddit.  It is fascinating, and I would encourage any interested developer to go do further reading.  For the average rabid magic fan who is bitten by this: this kind of bug happens (often), it happened here, it briefly sucked, it's being fixed, and tomorrow we'll all still probably be good people enjoying a good world. &lt;3

I'm saying that I think the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the first team is greater than the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the second team.

It's unlikely she was talking about the storm of the 8th, because, as you said, school was canceled that day. And the next two days were Saturday and Sunday, so there never would have been school anyway.  newlinechar  newlinechar So what day could she have been talking about? It didn't snow the rest of January after MLK day. The next time it snowed was February 12. So it's possible she's talking about that day. But by then, Hae's body had been found. It would seem highly unusual for Asia to specifically remember talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae after Hae's body was found. newlinechar  newlinechar It also snowed the week of February 23. So she could have been talking about those days, I suppose. But it didn't seem to snow enough to close school for 2 days. And Hae's body had already been found so, again, talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae would not have happened. Adnan was arrested on the 28th, so it couldn't have been any day after that.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only day that fits Asia's description (a storm so severe that it cancelled two days of school and she was talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae) was January 13th. Any earlier and they weren't broken up. Any later and Hae was already dead. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that thread is nitpicking. It complains because SK said that there was an ice storm on the night of the 13th, but that storm didn't actually start until the 14th. Completely irrelevant. If you go to sleep on the 13th and wake up to a storm, it doesn't actually matter is the storm started at 11:59 pm on the 13th or 12:01 am on the 14th. What matters is that the storm canceled school on the 14th.

You're definitely right about how big of an impact his cap hit would have. But every Bills fan has said the offense was underperforming under Marrone. Cutler is a good QB. I don't think it's crazy to think that they'd have high odds to get into the playoffs, even with a new HC. Not because he's a great QB, but because he's at least an improvement on what they had this year. And they were right in the mix. newlinechar  newlinechar I know the dream is to draft a franchise QB and build around the draft and undervalued player in FA. But they aren't going to be bad enough any time soon to a top 3 QB talent and when you havent made the playoffs in 16 years, you have to do something to change that now.

&gt; Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar It's already ridiculous, but a 4th attempt would be completely over the top.  As for a spin off I'm somewhat confident it will happen as long as Disney allows it, cause the show's ratings got a huge boost from the Frozen arc.  If not a spin off maybe Anna and Elsa will return to the main show for another arc. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have a link, but wasn't there an interview with Tyler Jacob Moore (Hans) earlier in the season talking about Hans' story picking up with his return to the Southern Isles after the events of the movie?  Since that didn't happen it's possible that he accidentally revealed something from the spin off instead of season 4A.  Maybe there's a spin off in the works set during the 2 years between Frozen and OUaT Season 4A. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. newlinechar  newlinechar I saw a lot of hate from the Once subreddit and certain podcasts, but I don't know. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. newlinechar  newlinechar Disney didn't do that, the books were never canonical.  The Force Unleashed games are canon, but other than that it's all a bunch of contradicting alternate universes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know, from what I've seen the Elsa and Anna series of books at least is basically just sisterly fluff set after the movie, nothing that's likely to be contradicted in Frozen 2 as long as they set it a couple years after the first movie or something like that. newlinechar  newlinechar I really just want more canon Frozen.  Like I know we're getting Frozen Fever and that's canon, but I would like for the books to be canon too.

Thing is, you can say the exact opposite for abortion. If women don't want kids so badly but want to sleep with the whole town, they should get their tubes tied by your logic. The reason that doesn't work is that a vasectomy (or tying tubes) is a *permanent* procedure. Why should men be forced to waive their reproductive rights for life just to not have to deal with children? They shouldn't is the answer to that question.

In arcade they are basically a kill streak reward, you need to kill two enemies to get into a medium bomber/attacker, or three to get into a heavy bomber.

When you're talking about physical traits, I'm glad that I have a womanly voice, face and shape, sure. I'd feel a little miffed if someone told me I was manly in some physical way because being physically womanly pleases me. I like to look traditionally feminine with long hair and shaved legs and makeup and dresses; it's fun. I totally get why a guy who wants to look physically manly would be unhappy at being told he looked feminine in some fashion. Nothing sexist about wanting to look like a magnificent hunk of hot hot manliness/womanliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you're talking about professions and capabilities, though, you're treading on far shakier ground because these things aren't just superficial; they have very real implications for how a person lives, and saying that, for example, having women enter STEM fields en masse makes some men uncomfortable cannot be easily solved by saying, 'Okay, ladies, back to the secretarial pool with you.' That genie is out of the bottle, and she's working in your lab or studio or boardroom.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you describe wanting to keep women out of male-centric parts of life, the unfortunate side effect is keeping women *down*. I'm not saying that's what you intend; I don't believe you do, and I appreciate your having a real discussion about something I'm seeing in a new light. That's the net effect, though, of suggesting men must have somewhere away from women to retreat to retain their manliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar While women have visibly moved into areas that used to be exclusively male, men have quietly moved into areas that used to be overwhelmingly female domains. Nurses, teachers, stay-at-home parents -- guys can do these things now, and as far as I know, there hasn't been a huge backlash from women claiming it makes them feel unfeminine to have male nurses and nannies. No one has said, 'Now that men take an unabashed delight in caring for their children, how can I still feel feminine?'  newlinechar  newlinechar That's what I'm getting at: There's still a presumption there, unconscious though it may be, that femininity is less than masculinity, that women therefore lower the intrinsic value of something by making it less masculine when they participate in 'traditional men things.' You wonder 'If anyone can do it, how is it masculine,' but I don't know that any woman thinks that way about femininity. I don't think I'm less feminine if you, a man, do something I traditionally do. I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's *abso-fucking-lutely* meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries. These things aren't said to girls and women as an accurate and neutral assessment of their skills; they're said to boys and men to demean them because in the speaker's mind, being compared to a girl is *a very bad thing*.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to live in a world in which doing things 'like a girl' is not automatically considered less good than doing things 'like a boy.' When that happens, maybe we'll stop worrying about whether having a woman as a company's CEO somehow takes away from men's masculinity. newlinechar  newlinechar

Pay needs to improve.

The key is double trapping each beast. With 3 friends they all double trap the same beast. They are getting 6 crates per beast. Lets say they stockpile and want 100 crates on each character to last them 3 weeks. Thats going to take them 50 beasts.

The math and science in the simulation is really tuned toward non-atmospheric maneuvers. In atmosphere the simulation model gets really dumb about things like air resistance.

Here is my intuition based judgements on the Red Bull trio based on their junior career, watching them drive, their adaptability. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Vettel is very good. He is up there with drivers like Button, Bottas, Hulkenberg. He is a strong driver who given a dominant car will win consistently. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Vergne is more or less on a similar level to that, he is a weaker qualifier than Vettel but a stronger racer.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Ricciardo is a step above those two, but not quite in the league of Alonso-Hamilton. He skirts around about below those top two and there is no driver really on 'his level', just drivers below and above. newlinechar  newlinechar To me when you look at their performances around their entire career, against the team mates they've faced and just watching how they drive that is the likely option. I fail to believe that Vettel is just average and Ricciardo is above average, but nor do I think they're the two best drivers on the grid. I suspect they're towards the front, but not at the very top. newlinechar  newlinechar But now that Vettel has left the Red Bull family and gone to Ferrari, especially with Raikkonen looking ready to retire in coming seasons its very likely we will see him against a range of team mates, maybe Bottas or Hulkenberg. Maybe a driver we haven't even heard of yet.

I am not implying politicians shouldn't be paid, plus if you look at our current model, they get paid well compared to the average citizen and that still isn't enough for the party so they get 'political donations' in return for  favours to business, but this is a whole other thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar What my title was about is that they get paid well for what they do, a chunk of them don't do it because of the goodness in their heart, they do it for money/ perks/ power etc. It is just a job.  newlinechar  newlinechar There is an expectation from politicians now that if they do a few terms they will get a certificate for doing their job. They get paid pretty well for this, this more than reward for most of them.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the honours system should be for people who selflessly give up their own time and resources to help others, not in exchange for money but just actually helping fellow human beings other things that coexist on our planet, people who put their own lives at risk to save strangers.

Yep, I see that as one of the cost of big budget games, or rather where every cent spent must be justified when they're not cheap to make.  newlinechar  newlinechar The weird thing is that Thief was a long project, announced earlier than DE:HR. There were rumors before release that it was a troubled project, so I imagine the project was reset a few times, and time on the final version wasn't enough to spend on the world. It's weird, because 'the world' should be a strength of the immersive sim type game that is part of Thief, and they should have known this as it was developed at the same studio that made DE:HR.
The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.

Zeus still isn't the cause of thunderbolts, and thankfully a naturalistic world view happens to be quite good at achieving improved understandings. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Right... the convoluted idea that instead of inflating the probabilities for a miracle to occur via an ad-hoc speculation... newlinechar  newlinechar The irony here is that you used this statement after speculating in our earlier conversation that the earth just happens to miraculously be at the exact center of the entire universe which as we now know consists of countless galaxies, let alone stars and planets. newlinechar  newlinechar Insisting that your deity is capable of magic and real doesn't make 'god' any better of an answer than it has when used by any of the other adherants of gods throughout all of history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; To rule out this possibility is to exercise faith. newlinechar  newlinechar If the odds are infinity to 1 against something, it doesn't take any leap of faith to rule it out.  This is exactly what the odds are that the earth just happens to be the center of the universe, and the odds against your bronze age deity are probably worse.  I wouldn't call that eloquent or logical. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I conclude that the evidence supports God. newlinechar  newlinechar You have yet to present any evidence other than the remotest impossiblity for the claim of geocentrism or your religion.  There are an infinite number of near impossibilities, including every lie and fiction ever conceived or yet to be conceived. Currently geocentrism and your religion have done nothing to seperate themselves from that number.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;... at their own peril. newlinechar  newlinechar Tacking on a threat to the end of your reply to try to get people to consider your particular specutive impossibility perhaps says something about you and your religion.

Thanks. Sometimes I really let myself down by having a tantrum, and I'm always embarrassed by it. I still have them sometimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example at work the other day something wasn't going right for a client and he had to get on a flight in half an hour. I knew how to fix the problem with his laptop, that he needed for this trip, but I also knew there was a chance it could royally screw everything up. So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving. She says 'NO FOLLOW ME!' and I yelled at her. 'NO I CAN'T, I'M BUSY!!'. I apologized later and told her I was in a very peculiar mood and should never happen. Its just that my dad just drowned a few months ago and I've been at the extremes mood-wise. newlinechar  newlinechar Another dude totally fucked up his order for new employees computers and when they didn't show up, I found that he had ordered only 1 and put in the comments 'I need three of these'. That doesn't work, you need to order 3 systems if you want three. I threw my hands up in the air and scoffed. I realized that was rather rude of me, and again apologized later in the day for my response.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3 years ago my little brother died unexpectedly and 2 weeks later I was with my spouse in the store and we got separated. As I wandered looking for him and his friends in wal-mart. I was getting more and more upset. I was getting so stressed for no good reason (just emotional) and punched a hole in a box of merchandise. Finally found him and started crying that I couldn't find him and I was angry.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know I have problems with my emotions coming out and constantly working on ways to deal with stress. Its a battle I'm winning every day. I really do try.

Once the vehicle is immobilized, it becomes the property of the police department in the sense that the driver is not permitted to move it without paying their outstanding fines or, for unusual cases, receiving permission from the commander on duty. So it wouldn't be their property, it would be ours. Regardless, it's theft to take the device with them once they remove it. I suppose that leaves them with either taking the device with them (theft) or destroying it and leaving it behind (destruction of property), so either way they're left with charges of some sort.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would be curious, however, to see a case where someone manages to pick the lock and leave the device.

Dated to me means of its time, and to me the CGI, occasionally ho-hum action, and by-the-numbers origin story structure dates it to that era. I'm not denying that at the time it was revolutionary, in the same way Star Wars was back in '77. But while Star Wars has dated in its own way as well, I think it holds up in ways that Spider-Man doesn't; the basic story structure of Star Wars is the timeless Hero's Journey myth, to me the script for the '02 Spider-Man has that early noughties restricted origin story structure (which as you said is still leaps and bounds above what came before). Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight are rid of those story shackles and shoehorned-in awkward CGI, and also are more daring in their cinematography (Pfister specifically says that in a quote for TDK), and as such are more timeless to me. They could both be replaced today and I'd believe they were shot in the past year. newlinechar  newlinechar I was so desperate to see a Marvel movie as a kid I nearly rented that Hasselhoff Fury from the video store.

You can't say, for example, 'hey, let's ban /r/Mensrights!' because you disagree with the comments you see there or find them offensive--they don't directly threaten anyone, and people have the freedom to not read what they don't like.

I'm just stabbing in the dark here, but it seems to me like a statement on the connection between the salvia experience and real life. At first glance the 'life' markers appear to encompass the entire bar, with the salvia experience ('sally') being just a subset of life. However, if you consider the shades of those markers and bars then the story is quite different. The shade of the salvia markers is the same as the shade of the larger bar that the life markers originally *appeared* to encompass, while the shade of those life markers is the same as the smaller middle bar; looking at it this way would indicate that life is a subset of the salvia experience. newlinechar  newlinechar The only way I can explain it further is to inject the symbology with my impressions I've gleaned from my few salvia experiences, but what the hell, it seems like a fun thing to do. To me this seems to mean that salvia (or at least, the things which salvia reveals to us) is/are a truth far larger than our lives, even though at first we see it the other way around (i.e. we think that the salvia experience is just the effect of a single, strange plant on our otherwise all-encompassing lives). My experiences with salvia have shown me a terrifyingly beautiful whirlwind of chaos, and so to me this image says that our lives are just part of the salvia experience, merely a subset of the endless chaos contained in that realm. It doesn't seem like an oppressive message, though; it's not necessary to read it from one direction or the other, so we can simultaneously contain the salvia experience within us just as it contains us within it. newlinechar  newlinechar Or something. I should probably have been more/less high when writing this ;)

&gt;You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. newlinechar  newlinechar First, there is plenty of material wealth in the russian west, and second,  russian siberian wealth was, if anything more easily exploitable than Alaskan wealth, which the US managed to get at pretty well.  Why?  because the US had a policy, at least up until the 1920s, of giving away land to anyone who was willing to use it for some productive end.  Russia had just about the opposite policy, formally binding serfs to the land until the 1860s, and only eliminating the last vestiges of those restrictions in the early 20th century.  The railroads in russia were not built by russian Leland Stanfordoviches, but by the ministry of rail, so it is hardly suprising that the US built more rail miles by 1860 than the russians had by 1905.  Again, choices were made, and choices have consequences.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it newlinechar  newlinechar Siberia, and russia, is a massive fucking place, it isn't all snow and caribou.  I've been there, and it's perfectly habitable.  And if you had offered to give it to whatever peasant got there first, it would have been settled. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade.   newlinechar  newlinechar trade in china even after the opium wars was very extremely restricted by the imperial government, as it had been for centuries, with monopolies on many important goods, imperial manipulation of grain prices, and limits on merchants borne out of confucian dislike of commerce. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't it funny how 400 million chinese couldn't resist british imperialism, but a few million americans could?  Again, it's almost like some societies are more successful than others! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's. newlinechar  newlinechar or more proof that brazil makes poor choices. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues,  newlinechar  newlinechar good thing the US [never had any of those.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War)  But, of course, you miss the point.  those weird internal issues are not random outliers, they are not noise.  they come about as a result of decisions societies make.  Not, as you rightly point out, in a conscious manner, but choices are still made.  Russian czars chose not to give away eastern land, the US chose to give away western.

Yes, the needs of the child need to be met.  An irresponsible and selfish mother is ill-suited to meet those needs.

&gt; As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think that's true of women, though? As men have become more open to traditionally feminine things, are women no longer sure of how to be women? I haven't noticed that, and I think the difference is that there's still an underlying level of socialization that suggests femininity is less than masculinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Women aren't afraid of losing their femininity as men move into spaces that used to be exclusively feminine because we aren't socialized to believe masculinity is lower than femininity. On the contrary -- men can readily move into those spaces and be praised for it. It's kind of how women can dress in masculine or tomboyish clothes and be thought cute, but men who dress in feminine clothes are generally mocked or reviled. It's because women are seen as taking a step up; men are subconsciously seen as taking a step down.  newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt;which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately newlinechar  newlinechar That's from a misunderstanding of what an honour or knighthood is, and for what they're given out. newlinechar  newlinechar People such as Elton John aren't given it just for inspiring work, but usually for other aspects in what they do in their position, like charity work, or making a major difference in the lives of the people (and not just by being inspirational).  newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, that's what Elton John was given a knighthood for - for his charitable services. Not his music. And it's what Bill Gates received a knighthood for (however as a foreigner and American, he's not allowed to use 'sir' (American being the US law doesn't recognise nor allow these type of things, and that non-commonwealthers aren't permitted to use these titles). newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar In reality, the monarch does not have any personal involvement in deciding who receives an honour or who is knighted. The people nominated, by anyone, goes through a committee, and then the Prime Minister 'advises' (tells the monarch) who she is going to honour or knight. newlinechar  newlinechar So the personal involvement that's necessary for a monarch to 'disagree' when another is crowned isn't present. It's not convention and will not be done anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar People who receive honours or knighthoods can refuse them themselves, or have them removed if they commit a crime. More likely if the crime was related to the reason for which they received the honour or knighthood. newlinechar  newlinechar If people are sentenced to prison for at least three months, or something like a doctor being struck off for malpractice, or any other reason, these cases go to the Honours Forfeiture Committee who then recommend to the monarch via the Prime Minister whether it should be removed or not. newlinechar  newlinechar As to whether the monarch in this instance personally decides or not, or whether she will still act on the advice of the PM as is convention, I'm not sure. It's entirely possible for her to decide, and that's what is formally said of this system. The Queen decides who gets awarded them etc. newlinechar  newlinechar One recent UK example of controversy is [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), who people think should have his knighthood stripped because of the paedophilia claims. Well, I think it's still claims. Not sure. It came to light once he died. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm afraid I can't think of any examples of it being forfeited after a crime, but it's gone 1am, I've been drinking, and it's now New Year's Day.

I've said this before on reddit, but I just don't think abortion is the solution. It's a symptom of a broken system. Poor sex education and poor access to contraceptives cause teen pregnancy, which is still extremely taboo. Fear of judgement and being ostracized prevents young girls from seeking out wise counsel and being able to consider all the options. I feel like our current culture not only could do better in preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it also drives people to what is, in my opinion, an extreme measure (abortion).  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think anyone LIKES abortion. No one is out in the streets saying 'abortion is great!' No one wants to kill a fetus, that's why it's such a tough decision to make. I think most of us can agree that unwanted pregnancy is the ultimate, but fixable, problem to tackle here.
I didn't feel a foot!
I don't see electoralism as the way to fundamentally change the economic system. Modern political structures were built in service of the capital-owning class, and even a socialist government elected by majority would face severe governmental hurdles and plenty of opportunities for reaction. I think the role of socialist electoralism is to build a movement and for campaigns to serve as early platforms for the labor organizing and community mobilization that will eventually make the economic revolution. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt Bernie Sanders will win the presidency in 2016. Massive surges by new parties have happened before, but I think it would require a bigger departure from established rhetoric than this 12-point plan. That's just to be the kind of paradigm-breaking movement that can inspire such a surge. It still won't happen if voters are too apathetic or too hostile to socialism. newlinechar  newlinechar If Sanders runs in a socialist party with genuinely socialist rhetoric, I'll support him. I don't think he'd win the presidency, but I don't think that should be the goal. The national campaign should be a platform for local elections, in which socialists could actually take control of city governments in presently Democrat-dominated districts. For example, Milwaukee has 38 years of history of socialist government and a mayoral election in 2016. Taking it back for socialists would be a big step for once again proving that socialist governance can get results. Combined with increased labor organizing and readying ourselves to fight reaction, we can actually advance the movement.

Although with that said, I would consider the points of some of the other responders there.  Every academic field is different, as well as their relationship to both businesses and the public. newlinechar  newlinechar I merely sought to point out that there will be no escape from personal politicking and backstabbing in the private sector.  Certainly there are good companies and good academia, but these problems are functions of (many) institutions, and frequently in a field with scarce job opportunities, one does not have the luxury to avoid being employed by those institutions, be they corporate or educational.   newlinechar  newlinechar In the end though, I strongly favor pursuing interests for your OWN interests.

The main problem with your point is that it assumes you have a single card win condition. newlinechar  newlinechar For one, I think that if you have a deck with a single card you need to win, then you need to rethink your deck. Control decks tend to want to get most every card in the deck played at some point or another, but I wouldn't say there is any one card that causes you to win or lose, guaranteed. And aggro decks... newlinechar  newlinechar ...brings me to my second point. Fel Reaver isn't meant for control decks. It's meant for aggro decks. It's a 5 mana 8/8. It's for aggro. And in an aggro deck, you don't care much what gets burned. You just need to keep drawing stuff to play to win quickly. It does not matter what gets burned. Unless you run out of cards completely, then Fel Reaver didn't really have a drawback.
For sure, I was agreeing with you that he wasn't the Darren Woodson we came to know and love yet.

I have already explained that my sympathy for Jews does not in any way detract from my sympathy for other people who have also suffered tragedies.  We are talking about the interesting fact that Hans and Margret Rey, Jewish authors of the 'Curious George' books, managed to get out of Paris only hours before the Nazi occupation.  This remains an interesting historical event despite the fact that many millions of non-Jews also died in various ways as a result of WW II.  I can still care about Hans and Margret Rey and their narrow escape.  I also care about lots of other people in lots of other situations.  I am not the one who is obsessed with the ethnic categorization of people.  The main reason why I sympathize with Jews is because they are human beings.  All ethnic groups are part of the human race and they all matter for that very reason.  Some people, such as the Nazis or the neo-Nazis whom we still have in our world today, believe that the various ethnic groups must struggle for supremacy, but I personally believe that human beings of every ethnic group should work together to make a better world for all of us.  Life should not be construed as a zero sum game, in which for me to win, someone else has to lose.  It is much better if we all win.

I'm not completely serious, a blanket fix like that would cause more problems than it creates. but overall guardians have the more balanced of the scalings and whatnot that I'd actually like to see on most other classes, then guardians can be mostly 'redefined' to be much more utility based than so much damage.  It just seems if you're not doing damage you're literally not doing anything right now, and utility needs to be a larger factor in the game.

I've been struggling with vulnerability for a few months now, partly thanks to my readings on gender and gender expectations. One interesting book I've found on the subject is [Daring greatly](http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592407331/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420073917&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brene+brown+daring+greatly) by the wonderful Brene Brown. She has done a lot of research on shame and the trauma it causes, and the one thing she has found to work best against shame is vulnerability itself. She describes ways we can strive to be shame-resilient and to be vulnerable even as people ridicule us for it. If we want to make a change for men, I believe we will need to do it ourselves. For our own sake. In any case, I don't feel comfortable waiting on others to fix my life for me -- it may be a gender expectation of males, but I want to  feel empowered and in control. Women will change, but I'm not waiting.

I would say because it's very difficult to measure the impact of a charitable donation, it's also harder to say donating or not donating is worthy of either praise or blame. A child drowning on a beach is an immediate problem, and saving them is an immediate conclusion that cleanly solves the issue. Obviously, donations aren't like that. They may feed a child for a day, or help build a new water filter, but in what way is that measured? How successful will it be? Is it successful or helpful at all? Can it even be potentially harmful? How will those results be translated into a medium other people can understand, and if they are translated will they be impressive?  newlinechar  newlinechar The second difference has to do with circumstances. Although it may seem otherwise, a child drowning is not in the same type of peril as an Africn child starving, for example. The starving child's problems were brought around as a result of their surroundings and environment, both political and cultural. Starving in this sense is not a random act, like drowning, but a part of daily life. It's similar to the Joker's metaphor about no one losing sleep if thousands of soldiers are killed in battle, but if a terrorist kills an old woman on the street it's a national crisis.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also disagree with you that anyone, including Bill Gates, is 'blameworthy' for not donating to charity. I would also say that someone on the beach who didn't help the children even if they had the capacity to is not in any way at fault or at blame for their drowning. Society might paint it that way, but the best way to look at the concept of blame is this: If the person in question didn't exist (say Bill Gates for example, or the swimmer) would the problem still occur exactly the same? If yes, that individual is in no way to blame or at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore the only thing someone can get from a donation is credit, no matter how much they give, regardless of numbers or percentages.  newlinechar

And, given his behavior with the lies of omission in the allstar and how he reacted to being demodded, I have a real hard time believing that he did make an error in good faith.

The fastest way to complete a set is to bank your honor points while collecting random pvp rewards from Battlegrounds, Ashran, and Gladiator sanctum. Only buy items to fill gaps- this will reduce the number of duplicate items you end up with. newlinechar  newlinechar - Side objectives in Ashran award a ton of random items, honor, conquest points, and give you bones... newlinechar  newlinechar - Buy a gladiator's sanctum, and level it up ASAP. Turn in bones from Ashran, and it will reward you with honor, random pvp items, and conquest points. newlinechar  newlinechar - Battleground dailies reward a random pvp item every day. (iQuality depends on how well your team does) newlinechar  newlinechar Protip: Don't buy a i620 2h weapon with honor, you'll likely get one as a random reward (I've gotten 3 in the last 2 weeks)

I'd love to see more content but I'd doubt that it'll be from 4LS because of its 4chan-monkeys-with-typewriters origin. That hasn't stopped its members from writing individually though, as we've seen with the recent [Miki path script](http://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/comments/2qb7pm/did_someone_say_miki_path/). Who knows, maybe some the main writers will or even have already moved on to new projects. The great news for us is that even if 4LS never reappears with another game, it seems likely that they'll be spiritual successors. One that I know to look out for is [Missing Stars](https://www.reddit.com/r/missingstars), which seems to be shaping up nicely and is even being supported by Mike Inel who'll create animations for it. Needless to say, I haven't given up hope :)

&gt; What is the point of that thought exercise if it has nothing to do with our situation? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Not a literal suggestion' doesn't mean 'nothing to do with the situation.' You're not familiar with [thought experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment)? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Have you noticed the price of oil lately? newlinechar  newlinechar It's still twice historical norms, and the drop in price over the last six months will very probably cut off production of the more expensive oil sources. That will give a better idea of the cheap oil production figures, which started declining in 2005. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There has been a massive investment in alternatives over the last decade. newlinechar  newlinechar So much so that now solar and wind provide about 1% of total global energy production. Somewhat underwhelming. And even so, electricity generation is not a substitute for liquid hydrocarbons.
Heh, all good.  I'm shipping internationally, so I haven't received my gift yet, nor has my giftee received theirs from me.
I thank you for giving a clear, concise and well thought out reply. I completely disagree with you, but I respect your right to feel this way and I am appreciative of you sharing your views. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, an author could sell those books online. But can one person compete with a huge publisher that will fill every bookstore in the nation with those books? No. While the author may make some more money from his work selling it, it will likely pale to the potential millions that other's will make. newlinechar  newlinechar Could he be involved in the making of a movie? Sure, but it is just as likely that a film studio would either have little to do with him or nothing at all to do with him. newlinechar  newlinechar Does all this new exposure gain him new fans? Absolutely! Can he then cash in on that with future books? Sure. That is to say, he has ideas for  future works or can put them out at a reasonable rate. Remember, it took him 20 years to come up with and write his last book. Maybe he has another idea and can put something out right away. Maybe it takes him another decade. newlinechar  newlinechar Making art is not like fixing a car or digging a ditch. With those things you know exactly what you need to do, how to do it, what tools you need and how long it will take. Some people (like Stephen King) have a ton of ideas and can produce them quickly. Others can't and don't. It is a different type of endeavor and should be looked upon as such. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I think an artists should control the rights to their work while for the length of their lives. This will allow them to not only make money from them, but control how they are used. Take for example and artist who is opposed to their working being used in a TV commercial because they want it looked at as art, not as a marketing tool. They should have the right to say how it is used at least while they are alive. They shouldn't have to turn on the TV and see their work being used to sell a shoe or a brand of beer just because it has been 10 years since they created it.
But, even those places still have the rampant materialism that this man is commenting on.

I am amazed that this seems to be so poorly followed. I live in the UK and guns are pretty much non existent for most of the population. My dad taught me to shoot when I was younger and even though the only guns I ever owned were .22 air pistols or rifles it was the first thing he taught me and he also made sure it was enforced. I always assumed that in the states this would be like knowing the national anthem. Of course we usually only hear about these things when they are not following the rule. You never hear about the 1000,s of times people practice good gun safety.

Generally I turn down the extremely weird ones or totally unreasonable ones, just because they usually aren't paying a professional wage (or any wage).  Usually the weirdest jobs are character roles that an independent filmmaker or animator has created -- for instance, I just did the voice for a haunted house for a short film.  My character was a sentient, talking haunted house that basically was going senile, so it wanted to still be evil and cruel but it couldn't remember much anymore.  So, that was interesting.  That film hasn't been finished yet. newlinechar  newlinechar The strangest DIRECTION I've been given is another thing, though.  I had a client who was another independent director who wanted me to narrate his promo trailer video, and for one specific line, he told me all of the following: newlinechar  newlinechar Read it like you're a supervillain.  Read it like you're an evil cultist that is kind of maniacal and insane.  Read it like Mr. Rogers, but, like, almost like he's about to crack.  Read it like you're explaining your evil plan to James Bond.  Read it like you're Batman catching a criminal. newlinechar  newlinechar And I could go on.  Clients are usually weirder than the jobs are!

Dave Reisner initially packages systemd for archlinux and back in the early days it was a lot of work to run. You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while. newlinechar  newlinechar What happened was two-fold: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up. newlinechar  newlinechar Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.

The lightning proc from mjollnir is a lot stronger than maelstrom, it also has the lightning shield.

Haha I guess I'm just bad at opening boxes. We'll see how the manager handles it.
It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell. 
I don't want anything serious though. As long as you promise 0 emotional attachment.

The difficulty for me is knowing where the proper balance is, you know?  Like, I feel immodest and like I'm trying to draw attention to myself, in most women's clothing.

And I know we're not expected to dress like that, but it still means that if I'm not following those rules, or if I want to wear something because it looks nice, it feels like I'm drawing attention to myself.  I only feel modest in clothing that makes me look like a little girl.

Come to 409 my CLANGA has a broken weld and sounds comparably deadened.
Not all the time, but generally a few times a week. She has seen a vet, who suggested I try changing her food to one with different ingredients. I did manage to find a grain-free duck pate that she eats (contrary to my slight exaggeration above, when I said she'll only eat chicken) and a grain-free dry food with duck that she'd eat, but she would still throw up. Given that there is no overlap between the ingredients of those foods, it seems that she just eats too quickly.

I never said it was bad. I'm sure for some people it is a fine CPU, but for gamers, choosing a CPU with only two threads isn't a good decision as it limits your selection of games and there is good reason to believe that the need for at least four threads for games is only going to become more common. newlinechar  newlinechar I just don't get why the Pentium G3258 has become a meta in this subreddit.

All Jews ignore certain parts of the Torah. The Torah has the death penalty for like every other thing. There are also an enormous number of supporting documents created by important cultural figures and theologians throughout the millennia. Different communities read different texts, interpret different things differently, or simply ignore other things. My suspicion having met many Jews, Christians,  and Muslims in my life is that the moderates don't even read their core texts. Extremists not only read core texts and supporting documents, but they also take traditions in their communities very seriously. Sexual segregation in ultra orthodox communities and face coverings in ultra conservative Muslim communities are examples of traditions, not so much specifically religiously mandated acts.

Maybe he's decided he doesn't give a fuck.

Right, which I think is really useful to know. But what I've seen happen is people read this and then forget what the cold hard reality is, you are dealing with another human being who hears these kinds of lines all day long, the safest thing you can do is be extremely polite, friendly, and cooperate until you're asked to do something that you're not comfortable with. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I'm going to roll my window all the way down, I'll keep my hands in plain sight. I'm happy to provide my ID, and insurance, blah, blah, blah. If he asks me to step out of my car so he can search it, then the answers is a definite no unless he has a good reason. But hopefully it never gets to that point.  newlinechar  newlinechar I have quite a few friends who are cops. Good cops. But they get extremely irritated and some of the 'tips' in here and they've told me straight up that they will 'find' a reason to hold you longer for being an ass. Illegal? Maybe. But I'd rather err on the side of being proactively helpful until it becomes a more serious issue. 
I think Judaism and Islam are far more similar than Christianity. Christianity took a big old 'left turn' when Paul took it to the Gentiles and its message became Hellenized (mixed with Greek/Roman 'stuff). That 'Trinity' bullshit isn't in Islam nor is Jesus though of as anything more than a prophet. But from what I've read you're absolutely right that early Christianity was around and had an impact on the formation of Islam.

Reaper is probably more flexible than anything for this kind of thing, but for different reasons. Ableton Live and Logic give you tools to get 'under the hood' and play with the routing. Reaper is technically more flexible because it open source.

Ask around at /r/Reaper or the forums on Cockos' website, but I personally can't help, only point you in the right direction.

I believe it's very realistic that some time in the future Ward may be contacted by either Skye or Coulson to help with a supernatural threat, i.e. the Inhumans.

Hm alright then. I'll change my comment to 'near-omnipotent beings' then.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Graphic Design University, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret branding ops for Fortune 500s, and I have over 300 confirmed logos. I am trained in kerning and typography, and I’m the top creative in the entire Art Directors Club. newlinechar You are nothing to me but just another dead pixel. I will gaussian blur you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Creative Directors across the USA and your Photoshop serial number is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can liquify you in over three hundred DPI, and that’s just with my layer filters. Not only am I extensively trained in tracing bezier curves, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Creative Suite CS6 and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. newlinechar If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little 'clever' comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking type tool. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit noise and grain all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
I totally get what you mean in terms of being cautious. There were a few times where I noticed that he put himself in between myself and others until we passed them. For example, we were walking through a parking lot back home (back in our old apartment in Queens), and there were about 5-6 guys standing in the middle talking with each other. He's on an extender leash so he was ahead of me, but I noticed him notice them ahead of us, slowed down until he was in between them and myself, and then when we passed them completely he sped up again. He didn't lunge or bark or do anything differently other than that though, it's only because I'm always paying attention to everything he does that I noticed it. Too bad he doesn't know what officer's uniforms look like, but again - I don't mind him being protective of me. :)

That brings up an interesting question. More likely than not, there are association footballers, track stars, people living in deserted African or Siberian villages who have the potential (numbers and intangibles) to start at some position in the NFL. newlinechar  newlinechar There are 32 starting NFL quarterbacks coming from a pool of 316.1 million. That means that in the US, there is one starting quarterback per  9,878,125 people. There are 7 billion people in the world, or 708 (rounding down) NFL starting caliber guys in the world. Subtract 32 (for those already on NFL rosters) and that's 676 who mathematically could start right now for a franchise. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to find just ONE of those guys before Sunday.

Except it's not about all Hasidics. Fucking read for Christ's sake. The post you responded to mentioned 'people who dress like that' and a specific sect, and you responded with a generalization about Jewish people, considering the post you responded to wasn't about any specific Hasidic section but merely mentioned one. You're so concerned about someone being treated unfairly aligning with your ideology that you're willing to shit on some other group. And I realize that certain Hasidic sects are backwards as hell and deserve criticism for their social policies, but that is almost irrelevant to what I said to you.
Each and every year millions of people wrongly use the term 'I could care less'. The phrase 'I could care less' has become a very common phrase used to express your lack of interest in an aforementioned topic. However, the phrase makes no sense. We, the people of the internet, must fix this! newlinechar  newlinechar Now, by using the phrase 'I could care less,' the point you are trying to make is, on a scale of 0 - 10, that you care absolutely 0. However, if you could care less, you cannot be at 0 caring, as there must be a level below that to care less. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, the correct phrase to express 0 caring is 'I couldn't care less.' If you could not care less, then you are Absolute 0 Caring. You CAN NOT care less than you currently do. Absolute Zero Caring. newlinechar  newlinechar **Summary:** newlinechar  newlinechar I could care less : **WRONG**  newlinechar  newlinechar I couldn't care less: **RIGHT** newlinechar  newlinechar [Duty Calls...](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png) newlinechar

Agreed, that's the point I'm trying to make.  If you say that power is a measure of loudness you have to agree that not only does a 60 dB wave have twice the *power* of a 57 dB wave, but that it's also twice as *loud*.  Of the three metric given (amplitude, power, or dB) decibels is the only one that really makes any sense for a logarithmically perceived quantity. newlinechar  newlinechar This is also true for light, although light is always measures using linear metrics (lux, candelas) it is perceived logarithmically, so 200 lx doesn't look twice as 'bright' as 100 lx. newlinechar  newlinechar Side note- This is why I hate words like 'loud' and 'bright' in technical contexts.

It's literally semantics. :D Synonyms are useless unless they have a slight distinction, after all. But yeah, before accepting a gift the social implications should always be considered. If you attend someone's birthday celebrations (unless it's a really large party), you're expected to return an invite. If they bring you food, you should return the dish with food in it (or a separate dish of food, continuing the cycle!). These things are important! newlinechar  newlinechar The ex is definitely a douche. Leaving someone after that long and so much mutual dependence with so little warning or planning is pretty much unforgivable. In our society, though, we can't go demanding gifts just because the person we gave them to pissed us off. It would be interesting, though...
For the same reason she somewhat pities Angel when Tina casts her as a horrendous spider monster that wanted to kill everyone - Claptrap didn't have a choice in the matter. His programming bound him to follow Jack. Installing and uninstalling the VaultHunter.exe protocols, according to Claptrap's origin ECHOs, also screws with Claptrap's memory, so it's possible Clappy doesn't remember even being the Fragtrap. Her whole purpose in interrogating Athena is to see if she feels sorry for what she did. Instead, Athena makes no apologies for the role she played, and that understandably pisses Lilith off. Had she run Claptrap through that same line of questioning, it's unclear if he even would have remembered, so it would've been little more than an exercise in futility. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike Claptrap and Angel, Athena had the option to walk away at any time.

That's an interesting point. Clearly the economic dimension is huge. And if you take France, Gaullism in the 1960's had a definite ethnic tinge. The best way I can think of is to track the differences about Algeria: in the 1960's it was about hanging on to French Algeria, with the National Front it is all about how Algeria was also the good fight (Le Pen senior was a paratrooper).  newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is that a.) the National Front is now distancing itself from that position and b.) Gaullism was also in some vague contradictory sense anti-Fascist, or at least based on the mythology of the French resistance: but that's becoming weaker as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar So there's definitely a continuity of sentiments but the direction and motivation is changing.

&gt; Sure they do. newlinechar  newlinechar No they aren't. Not even light works the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. newlinechar  newlinechar What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.
Fair enough, your average trainer isn't going to be able to tame Rayquaza. However, you're not the average trainer. You're the trainer that saved the world from a disaster of biblical proportions at the age of 10 before even challenging the Pokemon league.

These rare Pokemon are steeped in legend but it's not totally unreasonable for a master Pokemon trainer to possess one of them. newlinechar  newlinechar That's how I justify using Latias, anyway. She's one of my all time favorites and there's no way I'm going to box her just because she's canonically legendary.

I don't believe we do. Child support is designed to make sure a child can be taken care of. So long as giving the child a proper chance at life is an option (which it is through adoption in the US), why would we need to make up for lack of child support? newlinechar  newlinechar Bringing a child into the world is a financial decision. If a woman choses to bring a child into this world knowing she will have no financial help and happens to fail to provide proper support for the child (whether she knew she would not be able to or she simply falls down on her luck), why should she not be punished for it? If you try and buy a house but fall short on payment, the reason behind your lack of payments doesn't change that fact that the house gets taken away. Why would a child be different? No matter the reason, if you are unable to support a child (and need to rely on a secondary funding source to do so), why should there not be consequence for taking the money?

Eh, I disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar It has a lot more to do with strong structure than it does engineering.

Conversely, you could easily find many, many, many songs from the last ten years that don't work at all with the site. newlinechar  newlinechar OP is cherry-picking to make some stupid, played-out 'DAE think modern music sucks compared to le Queen' argument. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, if the final point is 'oh engineering got better' then...

&gt; Really most clothing that's not loose and untailored looks immodest to me newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing that you're doing fine and that your *perception* is a bit out of whack (and I have to guess, we're on the internet not in person).  That's not a criticism, as you're trying to do the right thing in being modest.  That's a good thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty newlinechar  newlinechar Nope.  You have your body, given to you by God.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest newlinechar  newlinechar That's on them, *not you*.  That is 100% out of your control and 100% not your responsibility.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Brothers and sisters, what am I missing? newlinechar  newlinechar Perspective, probably.  Do you have any Catholic women that you can talk to in person about this issue?  Perhaps talking to your priest would also help. newlinechar  newlinechar --------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar You can also look into classic clothing.  Those outfit basics that don't go out of style.  Right now if I were a woman I'd probably not be seen outside without a cable knit sweater and jeans (we guys have it so much easier in this area).  100% coverage, 100% comfy.  Button up blouses go pretty much year round.  So do slacks.  Swap out your accessories and you can somewhat keep up with fashion so you don't look 'young' or dated. newlinechar  newlinechar There are cool places out there (Edit: PM for a specific recommendation, didn't think about the rules for a sec) that not only offer some cool current and retro dresses and separates, but they also tailor it to your dimensions for a reasonable fee.  My wife loves these dresses--modest and cute as well as retro.  She has ordered me to tell you that you should never pay full price on such sites, as there are always coupons.   newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, in my opinion if you're trying you're probably doing fine.  I would highly suggest talking to someone you know if you have anyone you'd trust.

There's no such thing as preemptively abdicating, so I assume you're joking. newlinechar  newlinechar But there are people who think that Charles should basically decide not to become King in order to let William become King. Either by refusing the crown or abdicating like his great-uncle did. I just seriously doubt that's going to happen. Charles has lived his entire life expecting to become King one day. Don't think he's going to give it up. It's not like him accepting the crown means William won't become King. Obviously, William should out-live Charles and will eventually become King. newlinechar  newlinechar Gotta feel a little sorry for the second sons (Andrew and Harry). The pro is that they get to live like a royal, but with none of the responsibility or spotlight of being the first born. The con is that you live your entire life knowing that your only purpose is to be a spare just in case your brother dies before having kids. Then, once he has kids, you are truly superfluous. Andrew went from having like a 10% chance of one day becoming king to having approximately 0% chance on the day that William was born.

With each charge cycle, the batteries wear increasing the internal resistance of the cell just a bit. Marrying a pair of batteries so that they wear evenly over time ensures that you don't have one more worn than the other, which if you're lucky will shorten the cell's lifespan and could lead to venting because one is working harder to keep up with the other. It's also a good idea in a serial setup (like the hexohm v2) to switch the batteries in the sled each cycle (a on left one cycle, on right the next) although this is less important than having a married pair (depending on who you ask). 
Right. But if the marbles instead go down in value, say to 50 cents for 100 marbles, you've lost 50% of your cash value. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, it may be significantly more valuable or significantly less valuable or exactly as valuable compared to when you bought it. The reason for this is as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows speculators are trying to guess how much each bitcoin is worth and going to be worth, and those guesses change dramatically each week.

Ehhhh. A little bit of the manifesto and what other commies have rehashed to me. It has helped with understanding economics a little better, but that just made me lean towards syndicalism. Sure capitalism allows for people to get lucky and never have to do anything productive for the rest of their lives, but socialism has this miserable taboo that is so embedded in some cultures we may as well give up trying to preach it. Syndicates have been shown to work the most effectively for the most people in real life. But there's still thus competitive atmosphere that I see is necessary, but it's not exactly morally fulfilling. I think it's more a problem with people thah politics.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar

I'm not a structural engineer, so I can't give you generalisable answers. You can see before the reno the load bearing beam was below the joists in the opening that existed between these two rooms - probably because it was cheaper and easier to install in this configuration.  newlinechar  newlinechar No, you sacrifice no strength - the joist span is identical in both cases. As long as the ends of the beam are properly supported, and the beam is appropriately dimensioned and compositioned for this job (OP used an LVL beam), everything is the same as if there was a studded wall there.  newlinechar  newlinechar This may not be possible with a second story. The height of the beam is what gives it its strength. There may not be space between stories to install an appropriate beam for the span. Using a steal I-beam can often work. Also, both ends need to be supported with their own footing. OP's house is build on-slab, so its this isn't really an issue.

I've taken the test. It is extremely easy to tell the difference between 64 tick and 128 tick servers. There is far more movement stutter on 64 tick servers. When an enemy is running across my screen, it is far easier to hit and kill them on 128 tick. Movement on my end feels noticeably different too. Hitting 2-3 bunny hops on 128 tick is a cakewalk. Stringing hops together on 64 tick is all about luck.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't choose anything. Societies don't make two or three-way choices at pivotal moments. History isn't actually like EU4 or something. They had a small ownership ownership class, which benefitted greatly, and the rest of it was just dragged along in this inefficient, shitty mess. That's how commodity economies work. A small group of owners owns them and utilizes them, and they get wealthy while nothing else happens economically.

Crowding the referee is more common in football than other sports because a single decision can completely change the game. Things like red cards and penalties can easily decide the match. There's also no challenge system like in other sports, so decisions don't simply get reversed. It can also affect later decisions in the same match if the referee feels pressured to maybe even something out.

It's currently 4:30am here in Dubai, and I just got in from working NYE. Will get some sleep and get back to you guys to try to help.   newlinechar  newlinechar I suspect all these Xbox players with online issues actually have router problems. I also suspect some games with servers not on Xbox live cloud, may be using ports not used by Xbox live so the console is not configuring the router with UPnP correctly for the game. This could also explain why Microsoft suggests open NAT is better than strict, and why the online multiplayer test passes, but the game fails, and also why some players connect with ease and others do not. The router and LAN config is the variable.

I really doubt that, and that would be a longshot based on his  shallow understanding of Anna. He really didn't knew her for more than a day, so killing Elsa on his party was to risk everything based on a supposition over the girl. Sure, he could have said that a guard did it ad he couldn't do anything, but the fact that he led the raid on the first place would have been enough for Anna to distrust him. newlinechar  newlinechar It was far safer to just keep Elsa alive and wait for Anna to return so they could make a decision together.

Sales tax varies a lot more than that. Some states have none, some 4%, some 6%, with the highest being 7.5%. Then some counties (and some towns, I think) add their own sales tax, giving you anything from 0-11%.

'Now it’s clear that hyperglycemia (HG) alone or combined with hypercholesterolemia has synergistic toxic effects on the survival and function of stem cells' - Why is this important? Because stem cells are established to be reparative to vessels, which prevents arteriosclerosis (Yes, you know this - the one that causes CHD, IHD, sudden heart attacks, decreased blood flow, etc.). newlinechar  newlinechar But what if it is the hypercholesterolemia that causes the toxic effects on stem cells? 'Increased dietary carbohydrates, particularly simple sugars and starches with high glycemic index, can increase levels of small, dense LDL and HDL'. Even then, carbohydrates increase the rates of LDL, which we all know as a major factor in the production of cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no surprise that a diet low in simple sugars (besides fructose) and meat has been proven to be most healthy. That is the way our body has developed for tens of thousands of years of evolution.  newlinechar  newlinechar In order for a study to be done on low-carb diets accurately, it must either measure the effects of a diet where most of the protein comes from vegetable sources, or one where most come from animal sources. In this study, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506174), 'reductions in LDL-C concentration and total cholesterol-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B-apolipoprotein AI ratios were greater for the low-carbohydrate compared with the high-carbohydrate diet'. In this case, the low-carb diet got its protein from vegetable sources, a diet recognized to be very natural for our body. Most of the hate from 'clean' diets comes from the fact that not all low-carb diets actually do what they claim. We know that 'Low-carbohydrate, high-animal protein diets, which are advocated for weight loss, may not promote the desired reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration', but that is just indicative of the well-known fact that animal protein is not very healthy for us, most significantly when consume in excess. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottom line - eating healthy means eating less (something I didn't touch on, but is very important), and and eating a low-carb diet that is low on meat. These types of diets have been shown to decrease chances of diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer to diabetes.

There was even that summer where weed was legal in TO too; I think it was 2000, and they decreed that anything up to 30 grams was only a ticketable offence, and then quickly changed that limit to around 7 once someone who understood weights got a look at the whole plan, and then shortly after, the whole thing was scrapped it seemed. Still, for a few months it was a real big grey area with what you could be caught holding.

I agree. It's an absurd charge. But the point is to get the message across that this is not tolerated. I bought my console for 400, and my games 60 dollars each.

And this is gonna sound bad because that word got a bad reputation, but people are entitled to play on their console that they spent money on. And teenage little shits have no right to decide what we'll do with our time even on Christmas, 'just for the lulz'.

My husband decided to become a reverend, and as a result is going to school full time. Combine that with a poor-ish childhood and you create a person like me: frugal and concerned with saving money.  newlinechar  newlinechar There were some extremely lean years, and I started working at 15. I have put myself in situations that were less than safe due to lack of funds and no choice (buses and CTA through bad neighborhoods, broken down car in bad areas, putting up with sexual harassment at work because I needed the money, etc) and after having a kid, I realized I never wanted her in those situations.  newlinechar  newlinechar I get my inspiration from Mormon housewife blogs and Pinterest, mostly. I know Mormons are not well-liked on the internet, but those ladies have to present themselves In a certain way, have a bunch of kids (typically), can't really work outside the home, and need to make a dollar stretch. They give some darn good tips. (I should add that we are not Mormon, but still, the money saving tips are great!)  newlinechar  newlinechar I remind myself that any dollar I don't need to spend is a dollar my kid doesn't need to earn later in life. That stops me from spending money I don't need to spend.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We are in the process of moving now, from a really expensive extremely rich neighborhood, to a middle class one. We will be selling our condo, and for half the price, buying a two bedroom home. I make a good living, but at work, I'm the person who is always willing to help,  always willing to go the extra mile, and as a result, in a position to say 'I saved company $13m in 2013, can I have a 10% raise?' When you put it that way, and can verify it, they have a hard time saying no.  newlinechar  newlinechar I work as a female in a male dominated industry (like 99.8% male) and therefore NO ONE NOTICES WHAT I WEAR. Hence the capsule wardrobe.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another blog I read for inspiration is olgasflavorfactory.com. She has lessons from her immigrant parents on there.

Even putting aside this point, it's perfectly legal to show **pretty much anything in a movie**, since it's something that a studio can decide to release or not release, a theater can choose to exhibit or not exhibit, and a movie goer can decide to go see or not see.  newlinechar  newlinechar Broadcast television is a limited public space (there is only so much broadcast bandwidth available), and so it was decided that broadcasts in this public space should be subject to public regulation (the Federal Communication Commission). That's why you can't show boobies on broadcast TV, that's why you can't say 'God cunt-fucking dammit' on broadcast TV and that's why you can't show someone's head exploding on broadcast TV.

&gt;So this was intended as a bit of a trap newlinechar  newlinechar Well [of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA)  Isn't that the whole idea? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If animals are ~30% as mentally capable as humans should we eat, cage, etc them? newlinechar  newlinechar Definitely. Though I'd put it at closer to 1%.  I'd also consider it a 'threshold' situation and not a linear one, so an animal with 30% of our intelligence doesn't deserve 30% of our moral consideration; it deserves 0% until it deserves 100%. And IMO the only reasonable line for that cut-off is: they're smart enough to meaningfully participate in the Social Contract. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Would you do that to a mentally handicapped person  newlinechar  newlinechar That's an interesting case to consider. Historically the argument has been made both ways. Personally, I consider this pragmatically: it's just not practical to have our moral/legal duties depend on qualities that are not superficially evident (imagine arguing with a cop that the person you just shot had an IQ of 59 and not 60 and therefore wasn't a person). The only unambiguous 'bright line' is human/animal. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;how do you feel about utilitarianism newlinechar  newlinechar I like the fact that utilitarians value ends over means. I dislike the fact that they quibble about nonsense like 'well-being' or 'happiness'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;don't you feel that in some way by being a vegan/vegetarian with the world in its current state that one is helping out newlinechar  newlinechar Abso-fucking-lutely not. See my point about population control. I really believe that. I also believe that people a) are incapable of individually affecting the behavior of markets and b) even if they could, it would distort the price-signals that markets provide, ultimately resulting in a suboptimal misallocation of resources.

Before Mad Cow was clearly identified the Cows in pastures would go crazy essentially and stop being able to function, they'd find a dead cow and take it to the meal grinder (thinking nothing of it) then a few more cows would die, they'd do the same thing.

No problem. It's easy to miss obvious stuff.  newlinechar  newlinechar FYI, you might wanna change your flair to 'Cis' or 'Cisgender' instead of 'Born'. Some people hold the view that trans people *are* born their gender, and claiming that your physical configuration at birth is all that matters can be transphobic (ie, trans guys aren't really guys because they weren't 'born male'). Cis is better because all it means is your physical configuration at birth and your gender identity have always matched.

Saying that we can't rule something out 'just because there is no evidence' is illogical. That is what the entire judicial system is built upon: evidence. Sometimes it's hard DNA evidence, sometimes it's circumstantial evidence, but *some kind* of evidence is the starting point. There has never been any credible motive given for Jay killing Hae, nevermind a mystery third person, so how you can see that as just as plausible as Adnan being involved (with all the circumstantial evidence I presented to you) is beyond me.... newlinechar  newlinechar You are correct that one person saying it doesn't make it so, which is why I mentioned the students and police officer who testified he asked Hae for a ride, and why I mentioned the Leakin Park pings that contradicts Adnan's assertion he was at the mosque, and the Nisha Call, which Nisha confirms, and the note that says 'I am going to kill.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand how you or anyone can shrug off all of the things I presented as a lack of evidence...

In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Using strong passwords lowers overall [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) of a security breach, but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective [security controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_controls). The effectiveness of a password of a given strength is strongly determined by the design and implementation of the [factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Factors_and_identity) (knowledge, ownership, inherence). The first factor is the main focus in this article. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g. three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secured with relatively simple passwords. However the system must store information about the user passwords in some form and if that information is stolen, say by breaching system security, the user passwords can be at risk. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar ^Interesting: [^L0phtCrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0phtCrack) ^| [^Password ^length ^parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_length_parameter) ^| [^Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password) ^| [^Dictionary ^attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)  newlinechar  newlinechar ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnata7r) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnata7r)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

I'm not sure I agree that there isn't proof.  You can see that the person is approaching the road.  You have testimony of the person whose car was damaged.  The damage to the car can be shown.  There may have even been a shoe print remaining or some similar physical evidence.  The sound indicates something hit the car.  The video shows the person is there and correlates his presence to the side of the damaged car and the sound.   newlinechar  newlinechar The question is whether it's more likely the car was damage beforehand AND this person did not hit the car or (in my mind most likely) that the person did in fact damage the car as claimed.  If the officer followed up diligently there could potentially be evidence from that as well.  I would imagine if this went to a trial, there is a reasonable chance of winning.

They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive). The soviets were not on much better terms, and between their lack of interest on the one hand and their inability to project geopolitical power outside their near-abroad on the other, they didn't do much.

The numbers located along the green lines connecting the stars are an indication of distance in light years between them. The maximum distance the connections are displayed is 10.0 light years, which is a convention for hyperspace travel.  newlinechar  newlinechar Since a vessel even with the best of calculations will drift due to gravitational forces, the usual maximum range for a safe hyperspace jump is 10 light years. After this point a vessel must return to normal space, recalibrate the hyperdrive, recharge the capacitors, and calculate a new course to continue to a farther destination. Remaining in hyperspace beyond the 10 light year limit can divert a vessel dangerously off course, in addition to the strain of hyperspace upon the drives resulting in malfunctions which render them inoperable. For this reason most hyperspace travel is conducted directly between star systems, using them as waypoints to reach farther targets while stopping to refuel and resupply. Fleets often arrive dispersed over several hundreds of kilometers from gravitational effects, as each ship jumps individually. newlinechar  newlinechar Thus the green lines of distance are also an indication of the routes that hyperdrive vessels take when travelling.

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I do Ft. Worth more than Dallas, and really I'm from Arlington so I was more hoping to point you in the direction of things to do near the stadium unfortunately. I'd say that you if you're close to Ft. Worth, Ol South Pancake house for breakfast, and Velvet Taco for a fourth meal are good places to eat that aren't expensive at all since it sounds like you're getting gouged on prices everywhere else. Velvet Taco is also very near the bar scene and is open until 3 on weekends so you can hit it up with a nice buzz going no problem. Torchy's Tacos may be better, but they does not stay open as late. If you're into sushi, Blue Sushi is immaculate, but a bit pricey.  Hopefully we can get some Horned Frogs in this thread to give you some good BBQ places to go while you're here in Texas. I would also put in a personal recommendation for Kincaid's Burgers, the one on Camp Bowie. I know a lot of people have their own burger places in Ft. Worth, but Kincaid's is mine. newlinechar  newlinechar Near the stadium, BFF bar and grill if you like chinese, vietnamese, or japanese has like 50 beers on tap from mainly Texas Craft brewers. Then there's Grease Monkey, which is really good burgers and a decent beer selection with live music often. Babe's Chicken, the Arlington location is not the original, but is still a good style. Beware though, all they have is chicken and fried catfish with buffet style sides. Even closer to the stadium, and a good tip for parking, is Lincoln Square Shopping Center. Back in September they were still running a policy where you can spend $40 at any of their shops and park there during the game for free. You can look up a list of restaurants in the center [here.](http://www.lincolnsquarearlington.com/dine) newlinechar  newlinechar  If you want cheap beers on tap, and cheap bar food that isn't bad, No Frills Grill in Arlington on Little Road does 3.69 Pints of some of the best beer you can find in the city. They even carry DeSchutes on tap. It's a bit of dive, but the food and beer is as cheap as you can find for bar food. It's pretty far from the stadium though. There other locations do not have anywhere near the selection though on tap, so I can't speak for those. It's about 30 minutes from cowboys stadium though. newlinechar  newlinechar  I'll keep thinking, and report back, as there are a lot of things to do in DFW.

I had the sleeve gastrectomy on Feb.18th. I used to weigh 324 pounds in 2012 but by the end of last year managed to get down to 270 on my own. I just couldn't do it on my own anymore and decided to do the surgery. newlinechar  newlinechar No, 40 pounds isn't much, and that's because even with the smaller stomach I was binging and comfort eating. I realize how extremely dangerous this is. I could have ruptured the staple line. But that's what BED will do to you. I really needed help and am getting help. Also, psychologically  I'm finally adjusting to eating less food. So things are going a lot better. I'm also exercising every day. newlinechar  newlinechar My surgeon would like to see me at 170 pounds. At this point, I'd be grateful to get under 200. When I get to 170 I'll decide if I want to lose anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar My recovery after the surgery was very simple. I was up and walking around the first day. Since I'm still so heavy I still have a lot of joint and back pain and get tired easily. I'm sure that will improve as the weight continues to come off. newlinechar  newlinechar Give yourself time! My surgeon told me 1 pound a week was realistic. Also, you may not lose weight again for weeks. Give your body some time to adjust.  newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing is to address the BED. If you are anything like me you will want to comfort eat and binge even after the surgery. Eventually, you will get hungry again and you're really going to have to fight the drive to overeat. Like I said, it's taken me nearly a year. This is the biggest psychological transition I have ever made in my life. Hell, I even messed up today when I ate a whole tuna sandwich. I felt like I was going to explode. I should have eaten half. It takes time to learn these lessons! newlinechar  newlinechar I wish you all the best with whatever you choose to do :)
They are. The current status is that it's in limited beta test. No idea how good it is... As far as I heard it's heavily cloud based.
I hate to be 'that guy' but the game simply cannot be balanced around low ranks. Think about it, how much of an issue was the CZ at your rank? When I played on my smurf it was never an issue, but anything above the AK ranks and it was completely absurd. People would switch from their M4 to their CZ to retake a site because of the 1-tap against helmets. If we balanced the game for Novas, it would never have been changed. Long bomb timers make rotating far too easy and honestly make the maps even more CT sided because they can really take their time with retakes. Also having any differences between the highest tier of matchmaking and the absolute lowest tier of these leagues is a bad thing. It's the same reason Valve stopped updating the '_se' maps, splitting up what the matchmaking community does and what pro player do make 'going pro' that much harder.

I last worked on the game about 3.5-4 years ago so I can't speak to what's been going on since, though I do know it is in pure maintenance mode - minimum staff, simply put out content and sustain itself. newlinechar  newlinechar Before that point, we on the team always wanted to put in game rune management in and it was being worked on at several points.  However, a lot of our resources were redirected into other projects such as some really ill-advised facebook games and integration with SOE's game launcher portal so it never completed, and the closing of our studio put an end to that.  The tutorial and new user experience was another area we were always trying to improve, but the will from management simply wasn't there to fund it after the first pass (the full game revamp of UI/simplification of mechanics done in 2009-2010 which included a new tutorial and new starter decks) failed to produce any improvements in our numbers.  Resolutions were a tricky spot - the initial engine for the game, as you might imagine for a game made in java by a mobile game company in the early 2000s, was not very easy to work with.  It was harder to fix than it looked according to our engineers, and there was never any real impetus from leadership to get it done. newlinechar  newlinechar Really the story of Poxnora is defined by the poor return on the marketing spend by SOE.  A lot of money was spent on advertising in really questionable places early on after the acquisition (such as sports and news websites), and after that failed the confidence of management in the game just slowly decayed away.  Generally developers are aware of the problems with their game (I was a hardcore player and addict of Poxnora for 2 years before I worked on it, and was always involved in the community) but unfortunately they don't always get to make the decisions.

To elaborate on this a little bit, natural movement is very complex. Eg. if you reach out to grab something you don't just tilt your shoulder and stretch your elbow, there is also some movement in the upper torso. And we are talking about some extremely simple action now. newlinechar  newlinechar Think about interacting actions (raise to the tips of your toes and stretch your arm to reach something), or worst of all facial expressions. And then those actions all have to fit together to produce an image that your brain wont instantly reject as robotic or fake (your brain is super good at that). newlinechar  newlinechar This takes a lot of experience and knowledge of anatomy to get at least semi-right if you do your animations by hand (which is why for most things, motion capture is prefered).

In theory, yes. In practice, not likely. To my knowledge of the different types of 3d printing I'm familiar with, none of them are able to utilize polymerization in the manufacturing.  newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, there would still be a lot of unreacted monomer stuck in the polymer matrix. Typically with nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 you can 'wash' out the caprolactam with boiling water or water vapor or other polar solvents like methanol, but most of the moneymaking for polyamides are in hot melt processing, after the macromolecule has been formed and frozen solid. newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, if the poly being used reacts at a high temperature, you could in theory use a laser or set of lasers to raise the temperature in a small portion of a solution to polymerize and build from there. One form of additive manufacting does exactly this, only by melting bits of a bed of powdered metal.

Your argument is totally valid. But I feel you're putting too much stock into the relevance of 'size'.

It wasn't about the bandwidth they were using, both sides (Client and users) are paying for the bandwidth when they pay their monthly connection fees.

Let's play 'The Reddit's standard karma guide'. 
Have no idea yet! I'll find out tomorrow when I go play ball.
I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema. newlinechar  newlinechar But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises). newlinechar  newlinechar I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

Well yeah they're dead, but I was trying to remind people that by drinking and driving you can hurt or kill yourself and others. 
I've been depressed for over 15 years. Nothing has happened so far that has made the past 15 years worth living. If I had killed myself then, I haven't experienced anything that would have been a loss. I've had some good memories, sure, but nothing that has made the unhappiness worth experiencing.  newlinechar  newlinechar It *can* get better, sure. But it most likely won't. To a depressed person, hearing 'It could be better' is the same as hearing, 'You could win the lottery!' For many, depression is a permanent mental illness. It can be treated but it isn't unusual to go through your entire life vaguely feeling as though killing yourself would be the best option. Look at Robin Williams, for instance. He had been getting treatment for over 40 years, but in the end it never went away and he got tired of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you feel that those who commit suicide are quitters, fine. I don't police peoples' opinions. I just want you to know what you're expecting these people to try to live through. Depression you experience for a short period of time is completely different from depression that lasts a long time and is relentless. I can see why a transsexual teenager living with fundie parents gave in.

What the Jews have done to piss off people in history newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Be different newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Continue to be different newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they (or we, since I'm Jewish) have been persecuted across the globe for the better part of forever speaks more to intolerance for religious and ethnic diversity than some evil plot by the money grubbing Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, Hitler's complaint about the Jews involved them being parasites in Germany and thus keeping down the ethnically superior Aryan race (which was a horrible misinterpretation of anthropology itself). This mostly arose from the Jewish influence on Weimar Germany, which had become a center for liberalism in the arts since the fall of the German Empire. The only thing the Jews did wrong was paint and write novels that were risqué and not traditionally German in the way Hitler saw Germanic culture. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Hitler going a 'little overkill.' You do realize that he systematically murdered 11 million people for no reason other than pure unadulterated racism, right? There is a big gap between accepting Jews and forcing them into ghettos like most of Europe had done. There is a canyon or two between ghettos and genocide. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I love this. Guy says Hitler had some legitimate reasons for hating Jews and only went a little overkill and is at +5.

&gt;Isn't it more selfish to want someone else to continue to suffer/live for your own benefit? newlinechar  newlinechar So if I understand you correctly, you feel that it's selfish if someone regrets the permanent pain caused by what can only be described as a very rash act and waste of a young person's life? My answer is a definitive no. If someone that you love confided in you in a situation such as this, are you saying that you would just sign off on it, rather than trying to persuade that loved one to stick it out?

I would definitely start with the Premier league here in England/Wales. IT is one of the big 5 leagues in the world and probably the most competitive. It is also all covered in English which of course helps. Try not to just choose one of the best teams because part of the trhill of football is falling in love with your club and sticking with them through the highs and lows. If you live near an MLS team I would definitely support them and go to games as there is nothing like it.

Again. He really isn't complaining. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I see it is that a phone developer is weeks behind independent developers. Which means they started late, and haven't incorporated public changes and fixes to the issues they point out.  newlinechar  newlinechar They received source 60 or so days ago. Why are there still bugs, why is this still in alpha phase, for things that have been publicly fixed for weeks?  newlinechar  newlinechar I am running a custom cm12 build with none of those alpha issues. They existed in the past. No more. Why isn't opo implementing those fixes?
TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though. newlinechar  newlinechar Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

It's a great game, and I love the story, but the gameplay itself is imo very dated. I don't especially like how combat feels, particularly with the 'overheating system,' and I don't know that I've ever met anyone that feels that the combat from original was the best. Combat (one of the biggest components of gameplay) drastically improved over the course of the series. newlinechar  newlinechar The inventory management is horrendous, with an unimaginably clunky UI and dozens of items that have little use other than converting to omingel. What was omnigel for? Why, bypassing the tedious minigames that they eventually ditched entirely. Don't get me wrong, at first I really liked the minigames. But you know what? I didn't miss them when they were removed. And further, when I have gone back and done full playthroughs since then (about four or five) the minigames seem frankly tedious. They don't really add anything unless you really like tedium. newlinechar  newlinechar The faster, refined, tight gameplay/combat from the later games was, I think, a huge step up overall. I do decry the shrinking open world elements later on in the series. But anytime I do a full playthrough I think, 'Ok, fine, lets get through ME1 so I can get to 2 relatively quickly.' newlinechar  newlinechar And if you're opinion differs, that's fine. But I was responding to someone who had trouble getting into ME1. And if that's the case, there's a good chance they'll be like me and they'll find ME2 a breath of fresh air after the somewhat plodding manner of ME1. newlinechar  newlinechar ME1 had some great moments, but for me, and I'm sure others like me, it's my least fun to play because of dated game systems that have since then been very reasonably phased out. newlinechar  newlinechar

I could definitely use more coursework. I've taken applied linear algebra, applied linear regression and have worked my way through about half of Boyd's Convex Optimization book.

According to OP's original post: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My Ndad wasn't always an N. Growing up he was the best father anyone could ask for.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My dads narcissism slowly emerged in the years following his accidents. It began with severe mood swings and paranoia, which eventually evolved into fantasies of self-importance and a desire for complete control of the entire family. newlinechar  newlinechar This is consistent with degenerative brain disease triggered by traumatic brain injury.  I really feel sorry for him AND his family.  He was doing his job and suffered traumatic brain injuries, and he was just left to disintegrate, destroying his own life and his family's lives.   newlinechar  newlinechar Our legal system is a total mess when it comes to severe mental illness, insisting on treating obvious symptoms of mental illness beyond the person's control as 'exercising their freedom', and insisting that the law can't interfere with their 'rights' to 'freedom'.  And then after they kill or permanently maim one or more people (or dozens, as in the cases of Adam Lanza and Seung-Hui Cho), it seems like the whole country starts another round of wailing about how their needs to be more funding for mental health 'treatment', completely ignoring the fact that these people routinely refuse treatment, and the law doesn't allow them to be forced until *after* severe, irreparable harm has been done.
How about I post my responses in the way I see fit - since someone who sees things as simply 100% needs a little clarification in their life.  newlinechar  newlinechar I used to get my fix from [CIR](http://cironline.org/), though I admittedly haven't listened to them in awhile. Their works vary - some is more Serial-esque while others stayed 'just the facts ma'am.  newlinechar  newlinechar Awhile back I was listening to True Murder as well. The difference here is that the podcast is just a forum to interview crime writers. So basically, you're getting the writer injecting his thoughts via the JO's show. It'd be like if someone (let's say you at your station) interviewed Koenig about Serial. Lots of self-injection though. newlinechar  newlinechar I worked at ProPublica for a bit and this method was actually getting quite popular for presentation - though it was less investigative and more presentation of facts/figures/policy.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ultimately I think you and I are going to need to agree to disagree. I really didn't see SK as a center of the piece. I agree with what you said about the abnormal nature of the podcast - but given my discussions with work associates, we felt she made it very clear where she was being personal vs. when she wasn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's New Years Eve, and I have no desire to spend it arguing in circles with someone who basically just disagrees with me on something that can't be confirmed, so I'll go with this: Serial is different, I'll grant you. We hear a lot from SK and I suspect a good part of that has to do with its TAL roots as well as the length of the format. But I would also point out there's a world of difference between Serial and the 3-part Jay interview and the decorum in which the two presenters handled the information. I asked you to see the difference earlier and you can't...not much else I can do for you. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy New Year.

The difficulty with any Japanese names with an R is that you are either going to bastardize the pronunciation into an English hard-R or you are going to have an name no one can pronounce correctly. I'd recommend OP avoid Japanese names with R.
I disagree with none of that. Although honestly, I always thought the idea was spectacularly subjective anyway. Even if we did call it 'best QB', everyone has different ideas of what qualities are important or unimportant anyway.

I'm a huge CoD fan but I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy Black Ops 2 but loved the first. The way they have the series set up right now, I think Sledgehammer will be in charge of futuristic games or have an Advanced Warfare trilogy. Infinity Ward will have the Ghosts series and will be in charge of any present day games. And then Treyarch will be in charge of WW2, Vietnam War, Cold War ect. That's what would make the most sense to me. I can't see them releasing 3 modern shooters every year especially with Battlefield branching off into different styles of games with Hardline.

By rules. Yes they are. So is art. Art is useless for the card. But the visuals do affect the feel of the card. How many people do you know that buy full art basics despite the fact that those offer no advantage over regular basics? newlinechar  newlinechar EDH is all about the feel of the cards, or at least the feel of the cards has a much bigger part than it does in other formats. So don't be surprised when people say some cards shouldn't be played on grounds of flavor. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not saying that they shouldn't be played. All I am saying is that we shouldn't ignore those who offer a contrasting viewpoint especially if they stand on grounds of flavor.

There's just too much uncertainty involved. You might be able to say that certain types of writing were *generally* to be taken literally, but that won't get you specifics when it comes to each passage. On top of that, each individual writer would bring his own set of beliefs. And even further, we aren't certain about what was changed and how accurate of a representation the current writing is compared to the original. It's also been translated. In many cases the story was an oral tradition for a while before it was written down. And in other cases, we already flat out know that some of the text has been changed, and we have no way of knowing what the original was. newlinechar  newlinechar We can barely have any certainty about the true nature of a single hydrogen atom, and you believe we can be reasonably certain about God's intentions for us as transcribed through a group of ancient writers?

Can confirm. Was at the premiere in Cannes. After the movie when we gave it a standing ovation, Schultz was in tears. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I just need to say, though, that I honestly think the homoeroticism is something that I think critics are reading way too much into. When I saw the movie, I never ever thought there was any homosexual nature in the relationship between du Pont and Schultz. I always got the creepy factor to be from the main theme of the film being how little the rich look at the poor. In fact, I think sexualizing their relationship REALLY undercuts that major point of the movie.

[Late Game Range](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166115821) newlinechar  newlinechar [Mercenary Army Expanded](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238025208) newlinechar  newlinechar [No Maintenance Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288622792) - I think that's the link, not sure. If it doesn't work for you I could just pop up the relevant mod files on Dropbox or something, let me know. newlinechar  newlinechar Along the same lines, I can mention a few more mods I like (not necessarily the names, but what they do): newlinechar  newlinechar * Cheaper Workboats - I really hate how prohibitively expensive workboats are for how finite they are compared to land workers that can stick around forever, and that mod makes them like ~90 gold or just a small amount of production, either being built in one turn in most cities or a few turns in a younger city. newlinechar  newlinechar * All Scouts get the Shoshone Ancient Ruin Bonus - I think that's an incredibly powerful bonus for allowing you to quickly get a free tech or go straight to no terrain penalty archers and composite bows (even potentially getting free techs in the late game if some ruins are still around), so I think it's fairer to make every civ's scout be able to do it. The barbarian encampment and map of surrounding area ruins are totally worthless IMO and this mod incentivizes always using scouts for ruins if you can to pick something better than that garbage. You can still pick up ruins with other units but lose the ability to choose, and I think that's an interesting strategic decision whether you always keep around scouts for that or just use your starting warrior or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar * Separate Great People Counters - This is probably a fairly well known mod but it means you don't have to min-max your great scientist and great engineer points anymore. You just get more great people over the course of the game, allowing you to use them in potentially interesting ways, and great merchants are no longer a pain in the ass but rather something you can plant or pop. newlinechar  newlinechar * Fixed Great Prophets - Prophets spawn as soon as you hit the faith threshold pre-Industrial era instead of it being a random chance. I think the random chance is completely garbage game design and this mod fixes that. Highly recommended. newlinechar  newlinechar * All Siege Units Indirect Fire - I think it's very weird how only a fairly limited amount of siege units get indirect fire so this mod changes that. Makes some earlier siege units nicer when you can have a melee unit as a spotter or whatever rather than having to put the siege unit potentially in harm's way by being adjacent to a city with a melee garrison or something. newlinechar  newlinechar * Faster cultural border expansion - I think the Tradition opener is just too good for this, so it means non-Tradition AI has a chance at decent tile expansion, and Tradition empires will expand quite far to reduce holes in borders and stuff and just generally control more area even if they can't necessarily work it. Can also prevent you from having to use a great general to get a strategic resource just outside of the workable range, which is nice. The mod was actually still too slow for my taste so I reduced border expands to 1/3 the normal cultural cost, and I feel it works well, though of course with like EUI it will spam cultural border notifications eventually. newlinechar

&gt;I believe sugar does not lead to diabetes (according to my nutrition text book),    newlinechar  newlinechar This is absolutely untrue, and if your nutrition textbook says that then you should write in to the author and tell them that was absolutely wrong and they should feel bad (unless it's from like 1990). Sugar is the biological killer, not fat (though high fat, and high protein can also be bad in different ways). Simple carbohydrates are bad for 1) Usually low micronutrient value (vitamins/minerals) and 2) simple carbohydrates raise your blood glucose much more than complex carbohydrates.   newlinechar  newlinechar There is obviously a lot more to it, actual bio/chemical science, but this is the basic principle. http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/carbs.html http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html   newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of things can cause diabetes. Poor diet is the main contributor, lack of exercise is another. Poor diet (such as a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates), even for someone who is in great shape, can be linked to virtually every major chronic health problem. Alzheimers, cancer,cardiac problems, lethargy, diabetes, sleep problems.....and there is some nuance, like sugars from milk and fruit are much less problematic. Cancer and diabetes are probably the most problematic. newlinechar  newlinechar **note** Some aspects of medical science, including dietary science, are kind of a crap in shoot. Some people say whole wheat bread is absolutely fine, others say it's fine but oats/rice/quinoa are better sources of complex carbs.

Agree to disagree. I thought he was perfectly in character, specially following his character developent as king in the comics. Most people didn't recognize him because of his new haircut, not because of the writing (for all the writing you get in the two seconds that scene lasts). newlinechar  newlinechar I get that some people think he should be all happy and cute like a cuddly puppy forever, but life doesn't work like that, specially for the ruler of an entire nation.

It's like seeing two different people because that's what it is - two completely different lives, leading his character to two completely different places.

I'm saying that I think the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the first team is greater than the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the second team.

It's unlikely she was talking about the storm of the 8th, because, as you said, school was canceled that day. And the next two days were Saturday and Sunday, so there never would have been school anyway.  newlinechar  newlinechar So what day could she have been talking about? It didn't snow the rest of January after MLK day. The next time it snowed was February 12. So it's possible she's talking about that day. But by then, Hae's body had been found. It would seem highly unusual for Asia to specifically remember talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae after Hae's body was found. newlinechar  newlinechar It also snowed the week of February 23. So she could have been talking about those days, I suppose. But it didn't seem to snow enough to close school for 2 days. And Hae's body had already been found so, again, talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae would not have happened. Adnan was arrested on the 28th, so it couldn't have been any day after that.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only day that fits Asia's description (a storm so severe that it cancelled two days of school and she was talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae) was January 13th. Any earlier and they weren't broken up. Any later and Hae was already dead. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that thread is nitpicking. It complains because SK said that there was an ice storm on the night of the 13th, but that storm didn't actually start until the 14th. Completely irrelevant. If you go to sleep on the 13th and wake up to a storm, it doesn't actually matter is the storm started at 11:59 pm on the 13th or 12:01 am on the 14th. What matters is that the storm canceled school on the 14th.

You're definitely right about how big of an impact his cap hit would have. But every Bills fan has said the offense was underperforming under Marrone. Cutler is a good QB. I don't think it's crazy to think that they'd have high odds to get into the playoffs, even with a new HC. Not because he's a great QB, but because he's at least an improvement on what they had this year. And they were right in the mix. newlinechar  newlinechar I know the dream is to draft a franchise QB and build around the draft and undervalued player in FA. But they aren't going to be bad enough any time soon to a top 3 QB talent and when you havent made the playoffs in 16 years, you have to do something to change that now.

&gt; Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar It's already ridiculous, but a 4th attempt would be completely over the top.  As for a spin off I'm somewhat confident it will happen as long as Disney allows it, cause the show's ratings got a huge boost from the Frozen arc.  If not a spin off maybe Anna and Elsa will return to the main show for another arc. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have a link, but wasn't there an interview with Tyler Jacob Moore (Hans) earlier in the season talking about Hans' story picking up with his return to the Southern Isles after the events of the movie?  Since that didn't happen it's possible that he accidentally revealed something from the spin off instead of season 4A.  Maybe there's a spin off in the works set during the 2 years between Frozen and OUaT Season 4A. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. newlinechar  newlinechar I saw a lot of hate from the Once subreddit and certain podcasts, but I don't know. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. newlinechar  newlinechar Disney didn't do that, the books were never canonical.  The Force Unleashed games are canon, but other than that it's all a bunch of contradicting alternate universes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know, from what I've seen the Elsa and Anna series of books at least is basically just sisterly fluff set after the movie, nothing that's likely to be contradicted in Frozen 2 as long as they set it a couple years after the first movie or something like that. newlinechar  newlinechar I really just want more canon Frozen.  Like I know we're getting Frozen Fever and that's canon, but I would like for the books to be canon too.

Thing is, you can say the exact opposite for abortion. If women don't want kids so badly but want to sleep with the whole town, they should get their tubes tied by your logic. The reason that doesn't work is that a vasectomy (or tying tubes) is a *permanent* procedure. Why should men be forced to waive their reproductive rights for life just to not have to deal with children? They shouldn't is the answer to that question.

In arcade they are basically a kill streak reward, you need to kill two enemies to get into a medium bomber/attacker, or three to get into a heavy bomber. The plane is randomly selected from a specific list, you do *not* bring your own planes to the fight.

Interesting, thanks!
When you're talking about physical traits, I'm glad that I have a womanly voice, face and shape, sure. I'd feel a little miffed if someone told me I was manly in some physical way because being physically womanly pleases me. I like to look traditionally feminine with long hair and shaved legs and makeup and dresses; it's fun. I totally get why a guy who wants to look physically manly would be unhappy at being told he looked feminine in some fashion. Nothing sexist about wanting to look like a magnificent hunk of hot hot manliness/womanliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you're talking about professions and capabilities, though, you're treading on far shakier ground because these things aren't just superficial; they have very real implications for how a person lives, and saying that, for example, having women enter STEM fields en masse makes some men uncomfortable cannot be easily solved by saying, 'Okay, ladies, back to the secretarial pool with you.' That genie is out of the bottle, and she's working in your lab or studio or boardroom.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you describe wanting to keep women out of male-centric parts of life, the unfortunate side effect is keeping women *down*. I'm not saying that's what you intend; I don't believe you do, and I appreciate your having a real discussion about something I'm seeing in a new light. That's the net effect, though, of suggesting men must have somewhere away from women to retreat to retain their manliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar While women have visibly moved into areas that used to be exclusively male, men have quietly moved into areas that used to be overwhelmingly female domains. Nurses, teachers, stay-at-home parents -- guys can do these things now, and as far as I know, there hasn't been a huge backlash from women claiming it makes them feel unfeminine to have male nurses and nannies. No one has said, 'Now that men take an unabashed delight in caring for their children, how can I still feel feminine?'  newlinechar  newlinechar That's what I'm getting at: There's still a presumption there, unconscious though it may be, that femininity is less than masculinity, that women therefore lower the intrinsic value of something by making it less masculine when they participate in 'traditional men things.' You wonder 'If anyone can do it, how is it masculine,' but I don't know that any woman thinks that way about femininity. I don't think I'm less feminine if you, a man, do something I traditionally do. I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's *abso-fucking-lutely* meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries. These things aren't said to girls and women as an accurate and neutral assessment of their skills; they're said to boys and men to demean them because in the speaker's mind, being compared to a girl is *a very bad thing*.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to live in a world in which doing things 'like a girl' is not automatically considered less good than doing things 'like a boy.' When that happens, maybe we'll stop worrying about whether having a woman as a company's CEO somehow takes away from men's masculinity. newlinechar  newlinechar

Pay needs to improve.

The key is double trapping each beast. With 3 friends they all double trap the same beast. They are getting 6 crates per beast. Lets say they stockpile and want 100 crates on each character to last them 3 weeks. Thats going to take them 50 beasts.

The math and science in the simulation is really tuned toward non-atmospheric maneuvers. In atmosphere the simulation model gets really dumb about things like air resistance.

Here is my intuition based judgements on the Red Bull trio based on their junior career, watching them drive, their adaptability. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Vettel is very good. He is up there with drivers like Button, Bottas, Hulkenberg. He is a strong driver who given a dominant car will win consistently. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Vergne is more or less on a similar level to that, he is a weaker qualifier than Vettel but a stronger racer.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Ricciardo is a step above those two, but not quite in the league of Alonso-Hamilton. He skirts around about below those top two and there is no driver really on 'his level', just drivers below and above. newlinechar  newlinechar To me when you look at their performances around their entire career, against the team mates they've faced and just watching how they drive that is the likely option. I fail to believe that Vettel is just average and Ricciardo is above average, but nor do I think they're the two best drivers on the grid. I suspect they're towards the front, but not at the very top. newlinechar  newlinechar But now that Vettel has left the Red Bull family and gone to Ferrari, especially with Raikkonen looking ready to retire in coming seasons its very likely we will see him against a range of team mates, maybe Bottas or Hulkenberg. Maybe a driver we haven't even heard of yet.

I am not implying politicians shouldn't be paid, plus if you look at our current model, they get paid well compared to the average citizen and that still isn't enough for the party so they get 'political donations' in return for  favours to business, but this is a whole other thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar What my title was about is that they get paid well for what they do, a chunk of them don't do it because of the goodness in their heart, they do it for money/ perks/ power etc. It is just a job.  newlinechar  newlinechar There is an expectation from politicians now that if they do a few terms they will get a certificate for doing their job.

The R210 II is extremely quiet, especially for a 1U server.

Yep, I see that as one of the cost of big budget games, or rather where every cent spent must be justified when they're not cheap to make.  newlinechar  newlinechar The weird thing is that Thief was a long project, announced earlier than DE:HR. There were rumors before release that it was a troubled project, so I imagine the project was reset a few times, and time on the final version wasn't enough to spend on the world. It's weird, because 'the world' should be a strength of the immersive sim type game that is part of Thief, and they should have known this as it was developed at the same studio that made DE:HR.
The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.

&gt;Naturalism accepts that the universe can come from nothing and information can spontaneously generate. newlinechar  newlinechar Naturalism doesn't currently have anything to say on the cause of the big bang.  As a viewpoint, everything (including information) comes about through natural properties and causes, but this is a far cry from 'spontaneous generation'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So simple we don't understand them. newlinechar  newlinechar Many simple things have been poorly understood, and religion has always tried to provide supernatural 'explanations'.  Zeus still isn't the cause of thunderbolts, and thankfully a naturalistic world view happens to be quite good at achieving improved understandings. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Right... the convoluted idea that instead of inflating the probabilities for a miracle to occur via an ad-hoc speculation... newlinechar  newlinechar The irony here is that you used this statement after speculating in our earlier conversation that the earth just happens to miraculously be at the exact center of the entire universe which as we now know consists of countless galaxies, let alone stars and planets. newlinechar  newlinechar Insisting that your deity is capable of magic and real doesn't make 'god' any better of an answer than it has when used by any of the other adherants of gods throughout all of history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; To rule out this possibility is to exercise faith. newlinechar  newlinechar If the odds are infinity to 1 against something, it doesn't take any leap of faith to rule it out.  This is exactly what the odds are that the earth just happens to be the center of the universe, and the odds against your bronze age deity are probably worse.  I wouldn't call that eloquent or logical. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I conclude that the evidence supports God. newlinechar  newlinechar You have yet to present any evidence other than the remotest impossiblity for the claim of geocentrism or your religion.

Once the vehicle is immobilized, it becomes the property of the police department in the sense that the driver is not permitted to move it without paying their outstanding fines or, for unusual cases, receiving permission from the commander on duty. So it wouldn't be their property, it would be ours. Regardless, it's theft to take the device with them once they remove it. I suppose that leaves them with either taking the device with them (theft) or destroying it and leaving it behind (destruction of property), so either way they're left with charges of some sort.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would be curious, however, to see a case where someone manages to pick the lock and leave the device.

Dated to me means of its time, and to me the CGI, occasionally ho-hum action, and by-the-numbers origin story structure dates it to that era. I'm not denying that at the time it was revolutionary, in the same way Star Wars was back in '77. But while Star Wars has dated in its own way as well, I think it holds up in ways that Spider-Man doesn't; the basic story structure of Star Wars is the timeless Hero's Journey myth, to me the script for the '02 Spider-Man has that early noughties restricted origin story structure (which as you said is still leaps and bounds above what came before). Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight are rid of those story shackles and shoehorned-in awkward CGI, and also are more daring in their cinematography (Pfister specifically says that in a quote for TDK), and as such are more timeless to me. They could both be replaced today and I'd believe they were shot in the past year. newlinechar  newlinechar I was so desperate to see a Marvel movie as a kid I nearly rented that Hasselhoff Fury from the video store.

I'm just stabbing in the dark here, but it seems to me like a statement on the connection between the salvia experience and real life. At first glance the 'life' markers appear to encompass the entire bar, with the salvia experience ('sally') being just a subset of life. However, if you consider the shades of those markers and bars then the story is quite different. The shade of the salvia markers is the same as the shade of the larger bar that the life markers originally *appeared* to encompass, while the shade of those life markers is the same as the smaller middle bar; looking at it this way would indicate that life is a subset of the salvia experience. newlinechar  newlinechar The only way I can explain it further is to inject the symbology with my impressions I've gleaned from my few salvia experiences, but what the hell, it seems like a fun thing to do. To me this seems to mean that salvia (or at least, the things which salvia reveals to us) is/are a truth far larger than our lives, even though at first we see it the other way around (i.e. we think that the salvia experience is just the effect of a single, strange plant on our otherwise all-encompassing lives). My experiences with salvia have shown me a terrifyingly beautiful whirlwind of chaos, and so to me this image says that our lives are just part of the salvia experience, merely a subset of the endless chaos contained in that realm. It doesn't seem like an oppressive message, though; it's not necessary to read it from one direction or the other, so we can simultaneously contain the salvia experience within us just as it contains us within it. newlinechar  newlinechar Or something. I should probably have been more/less high when writing this ;)

&gt;You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. newlinechar  newlinechar First, there is plenty of material wealth in the russian west, and second,  russian siberian wealth was, if anything more easily exploitable than Alaskan wealth, which the US managed to get at pretty well.  Why?  because the US had a policy, at least up until the 1920s, of giving away land to anyone who was willing to use it for some productive end.  Russia had just about the opposite policy, formally binding serfs to the land until the 1860s, and only eliminating the last vestiges of those restrictions in the early 20th century.  The railroads in russia were not built by russian Leland Stanfordoviches, but by the ministry of rail, so it is hardly suprising that the US built more rail miles by 1860 than the russians had by 1905.  Again, choices were made, and choices have consequences.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it newlinechar  newlinechar Siberia, and russia, is a massive fucking place, it isn't all snow and caribou.  I've been there, and it's perfectly habitable.  And if you had offered to give it to whatever peasant got there first, it would have been settled. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade.   newlinechar  newlinechar trade in china even after the opium wars was very extremely restricted by the imperial government, as it had been for centuries, with monopolies on many important goods, imperial manipulation of grain prices, and limits on merchants borne out of confucian dislike of commerce. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't it funny how 400 million chinese couldn't resist british imperialism, but a few million americans could?  Again, it's almost like some societies are more successful than others! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's. newlinechar  newlinechar or more proof that brazil makes poor choices. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues,  newlinechar  newlinechar good thing the US [never had any of those.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War)  But, of course, you miss the point.  those weird internal issues are not random outliers, they are not noise.  they come about as a result of decisions societies make.  Not, as you rightly point out, in a conscious manner, but choices are still made.  Russian czars chose not to give away eastern land, the US chose to give away western.

Yes, the needs of the child need to be met.  An irresponsible and selfish mother is ill-suited to meet those needs.  By giving handouts to woman who have children they know they can't support you encourage them to have more.

He has full rights to prevent a pregnancy before it happens. newlinechar  newlinechar He can try.

&gt; As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think that's true of women, though? As men have become more open to traditionally feminine things, are women no longer sure of how to be women? I haven't noticed that, and I think the difference is that there's still an underlying level of socialization that suggests femininity is less than masculinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Women aren't afraid of losing their femininity as men move into spaces that used to be exclusively feminine because we aren't socialized to believe masculinity is lower than femininity. On the contrary -- men can readily move into those spaces and be praised for it. It's kind of how women can dress in masculine or tomboyish clothes and be thought cute, but men who dress in feminine clothes are generally mocked or reviled. It's because women are seen as taking a step up; men are subconsciously seen as taking a step down.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I wear makeup because it makes me happy and I'm not about to apologize for that. I don't think that it's a ridiculous generalization for me to say that on a holiday where it's a tradition to get a kiss some people who aren't getting that kiss may feel a  twinge of sadness. And it's more likely that a person who is single won't get kissed so that's why I included it in the title. Good for you if you are happy with not participating in this tradition but don't go stomp on other people's happiness just because you're too far up on your high horse.

&gt;which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately newlinechar  newlinechar That's from a misunderstanding of what an honour or knighthood is, and for what they're given out. newlinechar  newlinechar People such as Elton John aren't given it just for inspiring work, but usually for other aspects in what they do in their position, like charity work, or making a major difference in the lives of the people (and not just by being inspirational).  newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, that's what Elton John was given a knighthood for - for his charitable services. Not his music. And it's what Bill Gates received a knighthood for (however as a foreigner and American, he's not allowed to use 'sir' (American being the US law doesn't recognise nor allow these type of things, and that non-commonwealthers aren't permitted to use these titles). newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar In reality, the monarch does not have any personal involvement in deciding who receives an honour or who is knighted. The people nominated, by anyone, goes through a committee, and then the Prime Minister 'advises' (tells the monarch) who she is going to honour or knight. newlinechar  newlinechar So the personal involvement that's necessary for a monarch to 'disagree' when another is crowned isn't present. It's not convention and will not be done anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar People who receive honours or knighthoods can refuse them themselves, or have them removed if they commit a crime. More likely if the crime was related to the reason for which they received the honour or knighthood. newlinechar  newlinechar If people are sentenced to prison for at least three months, or something like a doctor being struck off for malpractice, or any other reason, these cases go to the Honours Forfeiture Committee who then recommend to the monarch via the Prime Minister whether it should be removed or not. newlinechar  newlinechar As to whether the monarch in this instance personally decides or not, or whether she will still act on the advice of the PM as is convention, I'm not sure. It's entirely possible for her to decide, and that's what is formally said of this system. The Queen decides who gets awarded them etc. newlinechar  newlinechar One recent UK example of controversy is [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), who people think should have his knighthood stripped because of the paedophilia claims. Well, I think it's still claims. Not sure. It came to light once he died. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm afraid I can't think of any examples of it being forfeited after a crime, but it's gone 1am, I've been drinking, and it's now New Year's Day.

I've said this before on reddit, but I just don't think abortion is the solution. It's a symptom of a broken system. Poor sex education and poor access to contraceptives cause teen pregnancy, which is still extremely taboo. Fear of judgement and being ostracized prevents young girls from seeking out wise counsel and being able to consider all the options. I feel like our current culture not only could do better in preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it also drives people to what is, in my opinion, an extreme measure (abortion).  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think anyone LIKES abortion. No one is out in the streets saying 'abortion is great!' No one wants to kill a fetus, that's why it's such a tough decision to make. I think most of us can agree that unwanted pregnancy is the ultimate, but fixable, problem to tackle here.
I didn't feel a foot!
I don't see electoralism as the way to fundamentally change the economic system. Modern political structures were built in service of the capital-owning class, and even a socialist government elected by majority would face severe governmental hurdles and plenty of opportunities for reaction. I think the role of socialist electoralism is to build a movement and for campaigns to serve as early platforms for the labor organizing and community mobilization that will eventually make the economic revolution. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt Bernie Sanders will win the presidency in 2016. Massive surges by new parties have happened before, but I think it would require a bigger departure from established rhetoric than this 12-point plan. That's just to be the kind of paradigm-breaking movement that can inspire such a surge. It still won't happen if voters are too apathetic or too hostile to socialism. newlinechar  newlinechar If Sanders runs in a socialist party with genuinely socialist rhetoric, I'll support him. I don't think he'd win the presidency, but I don't think that should be the goal. The national campaign should be a platform for local elections, in which socialists could actually take control of city governments in presently Democrat-dominated districts. For example, Milwaukee has 38 years of history of socialist government and a mayoral election in 2016. Taking it back for socialists would be a big step for once again proving that socialist governance can get results. Combined with increased labor organizing and readying ourselves to fight reaction, we can actually advance the movement.

Although with that said, I would consider the points of some of the other responders there.

The main problem with your point is that it assumes you have a single card win condition. newlinechar  newlinechar For one, I think that if you have a deck with a single card you need to win, then you need to rethink your deck. Control decks tend to want to get most every card in the deck played at some point or another, but I wouldn't say there is any one card that causes you to win or lose, guaranteed. And aggro decks... newlinechar  newlinechar ...brings me to my second point. Fel Reaver isn't meant for control decks. It's meant for aggro decks. It's a 5 mana 8/8. It's for aggro. And in an aggro deck, you don't care much what gets burned. You just need to keep drawing stuff to play to win quickly. It does not matter what gets burned. Unless you run out of cards completely, then Fel Reaver didn't really have a drawback.
For sure, I was agreeing with you that he wasn't the Darren Woodson we came to know and love yet.

I have already explained that my sympathy for Jews does not in any way detract from my sympathy for other people who have also suffered tragedies.  We are talking about the interesting fact that Hans and Margret Rey, Jewish authors of the 'Curious George' books, managed to get out of Paris only hours before the Nazi occupation.  This remains an interesting historical event despite the fact that many millions of non-Jews also died in various ways as a result of WW II.  I can still care about Hans and Margret Rey and their narrow escape.  I also care about lots of other people in lots of other situations.  I am not the one who is obsessed with the ethnic categorization of people.  The main reason why I sympathize with Jews is because they are human beings.  All ethnic groups are part of the human race and they all matter for that very reason.  Some people, such as the Nazis or the neo-Nazis whom we still have in our world today, believe that the various ethnic groups must struggle for supremacy, but I personally believe that human beings of every ethnic group should work together to make a better world for all of us.  Life should not be construed as a zero sum game, in which for me to win, someone else has to lose.  It is much better if we all win.

I'm not completely serious, a blanket fix like that would cause more problems than it creates. but overall guardians have the more balanced of the scalings and whatnot that I'd actually like to see on most other classes, then guardians can be mostly 'redefined' to be much more utility based than so much damage.  It just seems if you're not doing damage you're literally not doing anything right now, and utility needs to be a larger factor in the game.

Not a chance. Nappa can casually produce more damage than a nuke, fly at hypersonic speeds, survive blasts that destroyed the moon with only minor injury. Vegeta is two or three times more powerful.

I don't mean to piss in your cheerios. We're all scratching our heads how to rebalance things.

It'll only take 2 loch'n'load pills to kill you. Sure the demo's aim has to be solid, but if you're spinning and shooting your minigun, your movement is reduced and there's no way to keep up with the damage that even a mediocre demo outputs.  newlinechar  newlinechar To put it in simplest terms: Operating at 240 HP as a heavy is a disadvantage with his current minigun nerf.

I've been struggling with vulnerability for a few months now, partly thanks to my readings on gender and gender expectations. One interesting book I've found on the subject is [Daring greatly](http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592407331/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420073917&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brene+brown+daring+greatly) by the wonderful Brene Brown. She has done a lot of research on shame and the trauma it causes, and the one thing she has found to work best against shame is vulnerability itself. She describes ways we can strive to be shame-resilient and to be vulnerable even as people ridicule us for it. If we want to make a change for men, I believe we will need to do it ourselves. For our own sake. In any case, I don't feel comfortable waiting on others to fix my life for me -- it may be a gender expectation of males, but I want to  feel empowered and in control. Women will change, but I'm not waiting.

I would say because it's very difficult to measure the impact of a charitable donation, it's also harder to say donating or not donating is worthy of either praise or blame. A child drowning on a beach is an immediate problem, and saving them is an immediate conclusion that cleanly solves the issue. Obviously, donations aren't like that. They may feed a child for a day, or help build a new water filter, but in what way is that measured? How successful will it be? Is it successful or helpful at all? Can it even be potentially harmful? How will those results be translated into a medium other people can understand, and if they are translated will they be impressive?  newlinechar  newlinechar The second difference has to do with circumstances. Although it may seem otherwise, a child drowning is not in the same type of peril as an Africn child starving, for example. The starving child's problems were brought around as a result of their surroundings and environment, both political and cultural. Starving in this sense is not a random act, like drowning, but a part of daily life. It's similar to the Joker's metaphor about no one losing sleep if thousands of soldiers are killed in battle, but if a terrorist kills an old woman on the street it's a national crisis.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also disagree with you that anyone, including Bill Gates, is 'blameworthy' for not donating to charity. I would also say that someone on the beach who didn't help the children even if they had the capacity to is not in any way at fault or at blame for their drowning. Society might paint it that way, but the best way to look at the concept of blame is this: If the person in question didn't exist (say Bill Gates for example, or the swimmer) would the problem still occur exactly the same? If yes, that individual is in no way to blame or at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore the only thing someone can get from a donation is credit, no matter how much they give, regardless of numbers or percentages.  newlinechar

Nah, I got you dude. If it's the same hardware but it isn't accepting the key you can use a different tool to do just that.

I'd love to see more content but I'd doubt that it'll be from 4LS because of its 4chan-monkeys-with-typewriters origin.

Thank you very much! Have a happy new year! &lt;3
&gt; What is the point of that thought exercise if it has nothing to do with our situation? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Not a literal suggestion' doesn't mean 'nothing to do with the situation.' You're not familiar with [thought experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment)? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Have you noticed the price of oil lately? newlinechar  newlinechar It's still twice historical norms, and the drop in price over the last six months will very probably cut off production of the more expensive oil sources. That will give a better idea of the cheap oil production figures, which started declining in 2005. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There has been a massive investment in alternatives over the last decade. newlinechar  newlinechar So much so that now solar and wind provide about 1% of total global energy production. Somewhat underwhelming. And even so, electricity generation is not a substitute for liquid hydrocarbons.
Heh, all good.  I'm shipping internationally, so I haven't received my gift yet, nor has my giftee received theirs from me.
I thank you for giving a clear, concise and well thought out reply. I completely disagree with you, but I respect your right to feel this way and I am appreciative of you sharing your views. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, an author could sell those books online. But can one person compete with a huge publisher that will fill every bookstore in the nation with those books? No. While the author may make some more money from his work selling it, it will likely pale to the potential millions that other's will make. newlinechar  newlinechar Could he be involved in the making of a movie? Sure, but it is just as likely that a film studio would either have little to do with him or nothing at all to do with him. newlinechar  newlinechar Does all this new exposure gain him new fans? Absolutely! Can he then cash in on that with future books? Sure. That is to say, he has ideas for  future works or can put them out at a reasonable rate. Remember, it took him 20 years to come up with and write his last book. Maybe he has another idea and can put something out right away. Maybe it takes him another decade. newlinechar  newlinechar Making art is not like fixing a car or digging a ditch. With those things you know exactly what you need to do, how to do it, what tools you need and how long it will take. Some people (like Stephen King) have a ton of ideas and can produce them quickly. Others can't and don't. It is a different type of endeavor and should be looked upon as such. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I think an artists should control the rights to their work while for the length of their lives. This will allow them to not only make money from them, but control how they are used. Take for example and artist who is opposed to their working being used in a TV commercial because they want it looked at as art, not as a marketing tool. They should have the right to say how it is used at least while they are alive. They shouldn't have to turn on the TV and see their work being used to sell a shoe or a brand of beer just because it has been 10 years since they created it.
But, even those places still have the rampant materialism that this man is commenting on.
You were 10 seconds slower than /u/i_swear_i_lift and it's your own thread!  Maybe you should try lifting as well.
That's like really shitty if they did. The more I hear about MiP the more I feel like we should have some sort of sub warning against buying from them.
I am amazed that this seems to be so poorly followed. I live in the UK and guns are pretty much non existent for most of the population. My dad taught me to shoot when I was younger and even though the only guns I ever owned were .22 air pistols or rifles it was the first thing he taught me and he also made sure it was enforced. I always assumed that in the states this would be like knowing the national anthem. Of course we usually only hear about these things when they are not following the rule. You never hear about the 1000,s of times people practice good gun safety.

Remove the coating from the blade, and use a good strong epoxy with 120 grit finish on the handle metal along with this idea and you will be fine I believe. Though some people will dis-agree, pins are mostly for aesthetic these days since our adhesive technology has improved so much.

Thank you, I'm currently trying to find a picture of him but it doesn't appear to be any that shows him clearly. Again thank you though!
He was 13 too but my house was crappy and stuff. I didnt want him to see it haha. 
Yes, you can choose from the firmware's boot menu between Windows via BIOS and Linux (with or without boot manager) via UEFI. newlinechar  newlinechar However, handing over from any UEFI bootmanager to a Windows that expects to be started via BIOS will likely fail.
In a colloquial Internet humor way, definitely. 
He never apologized to the guy and he does not keep in touch with him. The man did not even know his attacker was Mark Wahlberg.

This creates, in effect, a 'virtual [object database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database)' that can be used from within the programming language.

For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a 'Person [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science\))' with [attributes/fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing\)) to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain 'PhoneNumber objects' and so on. The address book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar ^Interesting: [^Apache ^OpenJPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_OpenJPA) ^| [^Propel ^\(PHP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propel_\(PHP\)) ^| [^List ^of ^object-relational ^mapping ^software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mapping_software) ^| [^DBIx::Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBIx::Class)  newlinechar  newlinechar ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnau2ag) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnau2ag)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

Generally I turn down the extremely weird ones or totally unreasonable ones, just because they usually aren't paying a professional wage (or any wage).  Usually the weirdest jobs are character roles that an independent filmmaker or animator has created -- for instance, I just did the voice for a haunted house for a short film.  My character was a sentient, talking haunted house that basically was going senile, so it wanted to still be evil and cruel but it couldn't remember much anymore.  So, that was interesting.  That film hasn't been finished yet. newlinechar  newlinechar The strangest DIRECTION I've been given is another thing, though.  I had a client who was another independent director who wanted me to narrate his promo trailer video, and for one specific line, he told me all of the following: newlinechar  newlinechar Read it like you're a supervillain.  Read it like you're an evil cultist that is kind of maniacal and insane.  Read it like Mr. Rogers, but, like, almost like he's about to crack.  Read it like you're explaining your evil plan to James Bond.  Read it like you're Batman catching a criminal. newlinechar  newlinechar And I could go on.  Clients are usually weirder than the jobs are!

Why are you an exmo?
Assuming that teenage me was half awake is awfully generous. I was lacking in self-awareness; let alone an awareness of what other people were going through.   newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from that, I can't really explain it. But the idea that girls are privileged above nerdy males, and that they have none of the social issues that boys do is prevalent. It's pretty much what fuels the misogyny in nerd culture.    newlinechar  newlinechar I have no deeper insights into the delusion. I'm just saying I remember it.  
Are you stereotyping us ziggies?!

Like I said the heavy tanks would have to be more like the experimental types that never saw production like the Ho-ri 1 and Ho-ri 2 both have 105mm guns, and 120mm front armor,  newlinechar  newlinechar Also you could push a little bit and go for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_61 something like that for last tier. newlinechar  newlinechar You'll have to break the 'rules' of the game a bit to get Japanese tanks into the game, don't just give them another nations because you'll just have the same nation twice with different paint jobs which is a lazy and pretty weak way to do something. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather have a historically inaccurate Type_5_Chi-Ri medium tank that has thicker armor and a bigger gun, then having them with no tanks or T-34s. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt;but the Chinese were not huge fans of the Vietnamese. newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't say they were.  But the Vietnamese leadership was very good at playing the russians and chinese off against one another for aid during the war. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There were some advisors and such on the ground, and that was it. newlinechar  newlinechar nonsense.  the vietnamese had, among other things, one of the largest and most sophisticated anti-aircraft systems in the world.  Do you think they built it themselves?  Russian aid amounted to [billions of dollars](http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000483828.pdf).   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I'm arguing that you should see things as they actually happened.  newlinechar  newlinechar that is a good argument.  you should take it to heart. 
When you [cut a donut in half, you can get two circles in a row](http://i.imgur.com/V6gxFg3.gif). For most donuts beyond 3D, cutting them in half will also make two shapes side by side. The more dimensions you have to cut to make it 3D, the more copies of donuts you get in that lower dimension.  newlinechar  newlinechar This type of donut makes 2 copies for each removed dimension. A runaway effect of canceling out seven dimensions is that you end up with 128 copies of a 3D donut, which came from one shape in 10D.  newlinechar  newlinechar 10D - 1 donut newlinechar  newlinechar 9D - 2 donuts newlinechar  newlinechar 8D - 4 donuts newlinechar  newlinechar [7D - 8 donuts](http://hddb.teamikaria.com/dl/KS7ATPWKJE64YVG0P3X8WY874M.png) newlinechar  newlinechar [6D - 16 donuts](http://i.imgur.com/1gVNq5P.png), and [this one](http://i.imgur.com/mirkvl3.png) newlinechar  newlinechar [5D - 32 donuts](http://i.imgur.com/OF0yfwv.png) newlinechar  newlinechar [4D - 64 donuts](http://i.imgur.com/TE30yAI.gif)  newlinechar  newlinechar 3D - 128 donuts newlinechar

&gt;No, but the thought of queers stepping up and calling the shots on what queer liberation looks like is apparently threatening to you newlinechar  newlinechar No, it isn't.
