The entire ESPNFC television show is essentially a bunch of arrogant Scots who look down on Americans, US Soccer, and MLS, with no hint of irony despite the fact that they're from f*cking Scotland, because that's what the self-loathing Eurodouchebag college kids who started following the Premier League 2-3 years ago (see [demographics of /r/soccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2qpzf4/the_rsoccer_2014300k_subscribers_census_results/cn8ehzw)) expect from soccer pundits. They'd do the exact same to your team if the opportunity arose.

Listen, I am not an NYCFC fan and will not pretend their existence doesn't piss me off because of the Chivas bullshit that foreshadowed this happening, but I do not blame NYCFC fans for it. That said, Third Rail needs to go fucking mental. NYCFC is Garber's baby, and if it fails, it is a direct Garber screw up, and if the Third Rail turns into an issue, the league will take notice. newlinechar  newlinechar You all need to protest, scream, yell, and do everything possible to cause a commotion. Every support group does, but the Third Rail needs to be the leader on this. There is going to be a lockout, and it is going to be ugly, but once it is over, the fans in this league need to send a goddamn message that **this bullshit cannot, will not, and will never be acceptable**. newlinechar  newlinechar This needs to be Garber's Watergate, Lewinsky, and Teapot Dome all in one. He needs to be gone. He is hurting the league, and we need to send the message to our owners that Garber cannot continue as commissioner.  This needs to be a coordinated effort, and I believe the Third Rail needs to be the leader of it.
He went on a troll rampaging spree on this sub for quite a while. Made some baseless accusations calling all 'boston fans' racist and getting into petty fights with people on this sub.

&gt;But, looking past the naming convention, we already have the bulldog repeater and the name bulldog doesn't represent a long range fighter very well, which is the primary attribute of the deep space fighter. newlinechar  newlinechar So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO). newlinechar  newlinechar Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well. newlinechar  newlinechar There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)). newlinechar  newlinechar IDK, overall I like the name.

Sure, you can. But they generally go a lot better if you're partaking as well. It probably doesn't make sense from a pure cash outflow analysis now, but for me it goes into greater relationship building that ends up directly affecting my salary. There's something to be said for the social effect alcohol has on building relationships. I have to deal with my boss in a very professional manner 95% of the time I'm around him, but he's good about cutting back and building our relationship personally when he takes us out to bars. This ends up affecting how we interact when we're back at the office. If he generally likes me as a person outside of work, it makes dealing with the things that come up inside work a lot easier, and usually translates into him being more willing to invest time into teaching me which helps me perform better and meet his expectations more easily. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, for client expenses it's always covered. At training events with my peers it's more hit or miss. At this stage in my career, it's an expense I don't mind having. As I get into my 30s this will definitely shift, but I have a ton more people to meet/work with. Free booze is the modern day mana from above. I won't argue with that!

Not going to know you are a girl if you don't bring attention to it. If a group of friends knew you were a man before becoming a women then it's different but if you find new people they won't know. Either way you shouldn't give a shit about others caring if you are male or female

Most Northerners don't. I have a friend from New York. He invited some of his friends down to visit. We decided to take them to Deep Ellum in Dallas. We got in the car, headed out. After about twenty minutes one asks from the back seat, 'what state are we in now?' 'Texas man, in about another ten minutes we will cross the county line.' 'Wow, how long would it take us to get out of Texas?' He asks. 'In this direction, about three or four hours. Depending on traffic.'

Absolutely. I'm bummed because, otherwise, I thought she was wonderful. I'd never met anyone quite like her and was hoping we would at very least be friends. I felt there was definitely a romantic spark between us--but I couldn't get past the nagging part of me that suggested the old axiom 'if she wanted to spend time with you, she would make time for you.' I guess I kind of always knew this might happen, but I'm upset at her choice of method. To maintain contact for 4 months and then just vanish one day without warning is pretty lame.

I'll start us off I suppose, a fairly long time ago me and my boyfriend went to a swinger party where I had met a really nice girl. I've never really been into girl on girl sex, I find penis-less sex less than appealing, though I've only ever tried it myself once. Skip forward to when me and this girl, who I shall call 'Megan' in bed, I'd taken off her pants, and after rubbing the middle of her panties, found a rather peculiar shape from the inside. After pulling them down, *PLOP!* out came a penis. newlinechar  newlinechar I freaked out and ran to my boyfriend (Who was waiting in the living room), as if it was some kind of roach as I was a helpless school girl. A minute later or so Megan came out crying, deeply hurt by how I reacted.

No doubt you're still better. Levy stands out an obviously better LB than anyone on the Bears today, even if you still count Briggs. But the Bears DL I think is comparable to the Lions without Suh.

Right, the same way you would when you play it normally on your PS4.
I just can't wrap my head around that happening though. In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR Ward won't be a 'Super Villain', he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him

That makes sense. At the same time, if you're already doing all the work of online advertising, deviantart, facebook etc, wouldn't it be a bonus for people to be able to come in and look at your artwork?

&gt;I'm going to speculate wildly and say that under 20% of RDR posters have read 20 pieces of literary fiction in their lives, and under 1% of r/writing posters even know what literary fiction is. But everyone reads genre fiction, so it's much easier to get worthwhile feedback, even if it's just a personal opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's interesting that you brought this up, because I noticed that there's a substantial amount of animosity towards literary fiction / MFA writers here (even more-so in /r/writing), and that people conflate MFA work with 'cookie-cutter narratives' and 'purple prose', when in fact –and just look at recent graduates from the Iowa Writer's Workshop– many of the best (and most original) writers today have gone through the MFA system.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's upsetting to see the general ignorance in this sub (and of course, the internet as a whole —this is already a very well-maintained garden), especially when novice-level attempts at literary fiction are met with half-serious 'oh you must be in an MFA program' comments. And then! To think that these same commenters have only published KDP Singles, if at all —and have yet to attract an agent, or complete a book / movie deal with a publishing house, or have their work looked at by a professional editor, or win a single grant, honor, or award for their writing (NONE of which requires that you 1) possess an MFA, and/or 2) write literary fiction). It's enough to give the literary fiction writers on this sub a persecution complex.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is primarily why I was speculating about the possibility of a smaller, more focused sub. There has to be at least ~20 of us out of the 4000 here right? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

We altered racist and sexist books and media by censoring the content. For example the N word was removed from huckleberry Finn. This is an was change because it simply requires deleting a single word. Where as inclusivity for lifestyles that do not align with those presented in the hypothetical novel would arguably alter the content the author was intending to portray. This could be seen as changing the underlying meaning of the novel which I see as as big of an issue as a heteronormative society. I am adamantly against censure for any reason especially when reframing the context of a novel so that a child or student understands it isnt representative of modern society is a cleaner solution. newlinechar

Generally what people say when they talk about progressivism in politics. Greater acceptance, more working together as a society, etc. Any thoughts that people consider new and morally correct. I'm not arguing against that, I'm just saying people will use it as justification to get angry at people who don't have the same political opinions as them.  newlinechar  newlinechar The more I think of this the more I realize I don't really believe in any absolute politics. Everything is situational and at a personal level. I disagree with a vast majority of people, but I'm not certain I'd say I hate them, just I dislike hatred and conflict and feel the only way to move past that is at a personal level. If people can do that, well that's good for them. Change past anywhere at our current level of incredibly basic tribal politics on any significant scale is, well kinda silly and unrealistic. Before I saw fascism as a way to harness this and make everyone relatively happy and alive, but now, ehhh. I'm becoming less of a dreamer and more thinking about moving into the woods with an echo box of like minded people to an extent where conflict would be resolved by agreement to the right of self, but even then I don't feel much morally better. Maybe the only way to be 'right' is to live as a hermit and be free of any poison that comes as a byproduct to human interaction. But that also seems radical and silly. Or maybe no one is right, and anything will work if people get defensive and tribal enough. And I think I just went full circle to why I'm a fascist.

&gt; the standard library is outsourced to a third party company newlinechar  newlinechar I've poured the last 8 years of my life into VC's STL, do I count? newlinechar  newlinechar As I mentioned at CppCon 2014, licensing Dinkumware's STL in the mid-90s was an excellent decision. In addition to achieving C++98/03 conformance, this made it possible to pick up TR1 and C++11/14 years later. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The marketing never pointed out the HUGE disclaimer newlinechar  newlinechar On VCBlog, I [clearly said](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx): 'In VC11, we intend to completely support the C++11 Standard Library, modulo not-yet-implemented compiler features.  (Additionally, VC11 won't completely implement the C99 Standard Library, which has been incorporated by reference into the C++11 Standard Library.  Note that VC10 and VC11 already have &lt;stdint.h&gt;.)' newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree that 2012 had a bunch of bugs, for several reasons. The biggest reason was the huge influx of new code (TR1 in 2008 SP1, lots of C++0x in 2010, atomics/multithreading in 2012). Compensating for missing compiler features was another source (e.g. variadic templates). Working Paper churn was also quite problematic (e.g. this led to weirdness in &lt;random&gt;). In 2013, [we fixed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/06/28/c-11-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013.aspx) many of these bugs (and switched to real variadic templates), and 2015 will contain [even more](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/06/06/c-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-visual-studio-14-ctp1.aspx) fixes. (I'll be writing another VCBlog post explaining the fixes between 2015 CTP1 and RTM.) newlinechar  newlinechar Also, since people always ask: 2013 shipped almost all of the C99 Standard Library, and 2015 is completing the missing pieces, modulo extremely minor omissions (I could look them up, but I'm on vacation; IIRC it's a couple of the FP macro things, and tgmath.h which is irrelevant to C++).

The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February. The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required. newlinechar  newlinechar The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter.  newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper).  newlinechar  newlinechar Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley.  newlinechar  newlinechar Long post but there you go.

my biggest suggestion is to not use rockin green.  I wanted it to work so badly for us but it really doesnt work at all.  Rockin green products are pretty much just entirely made up of water softeners.  You need a surfactant which is found in most main stream detergents.  What happens is 'dirt' gets removed from what youre washing in the machine and goes into the water during agitation.  The surfactant binds to the 'dirt' sort of like it being trapped in a little bubble.  So when the water drains the 'dirt' goes with it.   newlinechar  newlinechar That being said my biggest suggestion would be to strip them, do a bleach soak, and start using a mainstream detergent such as Tide.

Islam is based on Christianity.

Seeing as alcohol tends to be a lot of sugar, making sure he keeps an eye on his bloodsugars so they're not going too high. Since it's 'partying drinking' and not 'a beer with dinner drinking', it's going to be hard to even roughly guestimate what his sugar intake is going to be through the night. Unless someone has a good suggestion (which I would like to hear, too), he's going to have to take a reaction-based approach to insulin intake, possibly not taking a proper / final correction until the night is done. If the likelihood is that you're going to get pass-out-drunk, it's best to play it cautious with the insulin intake. Having the usual sugar tablets along is a smart move. You shouldn't have to babysit him, just be aware that on top of any hangover he's likely to be feeling the effects a high bloodsugar as well.

Totally agree. I'm on this sub every day and would be absolutely thrilled to become a mod. But the theory from our current one (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/2pdq06/i_thought_we_put_a_stop_to_dream_board_posts/cmvxrt8)), however is that the community is self-policing, meaning that problematic posts will be sorted out through downvotes as opposed to active moderation. I don't agree with it, but that's how things are running now.  newlinechar  newlinechar Reddit's moderation policy is that only mods or site admins can appoint new mods. And additionally. seniority trumps all, so that mods who were appointed earliest have say (and can remove) mods who arrived after them.

I'll second this. In some fields, a PhD is a great path to having many exciting and financially beneficial job opportunities. In other fields, it may actually hamper your job prospects because you'll have 4-6 years less industry experience than your peers, yet there aren't really many jobs in the field that would truly require a PhD. Then in some fields, a PhD qualifies you for only one thing: an academic job, in an era where 'academic job' has mostly come to mean 'adjunct with zero job security making less than minimum wage'. newlinechar  newlinechar So anyway, yeah. In some cases, getting a PhD is the best idea ever, but people should really do their research and be realistic about the prospects based on their field and their own situation.

I'm guessing manga books don't count? :P newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a big fan of the movie 5 Centimeters Per Second. It's available fully English subbed [here on Youtube and is only 1 hour long](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVbnt4vQE6w). It can appear to be a boring movie from the outside. There's no amazing people with superpowers or even villains. It's just focused on a story between a guy and a girl who become close friends, but life forces them to move away from each other. It takes place in a time where cellphones weren't commonly in use, so they had to communicate the old-fashioned way with hand-written letters. newlinechar  newlinechar It's depressingly realistic. The title refers to the speed of the cherry blossom petals falling from the tree. They're symbolic of people, because people start out close together like the petals on the cherry blossom, but they scatter and gradually drift apart. The ending is just an emotional gut punch, but I love it because again, it's extremely realistic and based on life. newlinechar  newlinechar It's kind of interesting though because now we have all these forms of social media and the Internet. I wonder if this movie would be less applicable to kids who are growing up now in the age of social media. newlinechar  newlinechar Also the animation is stunning, and I believe handdrawn? I think [this scene](http://thecajunsamurai.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5centimeterspersecond-5.jpg) from the movie is one of my favorites because the landscape is so beautiful. It's basically scenery porn. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy New Years!!! newlinechar

If Blizzard were banning more proactively and continuously it would be more difficult for farmers to maintain their herd, and it would keep the economy more stable. newlinechar  newlinechar I know Blizzard *does* ban, but I don't think they have chosen a particularly effective way to go about it.

Bugs I've noticed since the patch that really piss me off: newlinechar  newlinechar * Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere. newlinechar * Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf? newlinechar * Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F.

My pup has definitely lunged at people before. My roommate was making noise in our unlit kitchen in a large black hoodie, and Chief was whining at my bedroom door to go investigate. I knew it was my roommate who had just gotten home, so I didn't worry about letting him out. He lunged at her barking, but as soon as she said 'Hey Chief!' he turned his ferocious barking into his whiney greeting he does when anyone gets home.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another time we had some thuggish kids walking down our street. Chief was growling at them from the window, in typical GSD fashion, when the kids walked into our front yard and started barking back at him. I put Chief's leash on and opened the front door, mostly just to ask the kids to cut that shit out. Chief *lunged* at them snarling, and they ran off before I could say anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Would Chief had actually followed through with a bite/attack if something (like my roommates voice or his leash) hadn't stopped him?

I am finding so much bad and conflicting information about this case that it feels like my head is about to explode.  newlinechar  newlinechar The latest piece of conflicting information is a doozie. As I'm reading the article by David Lohr I'm thinking *this is great,up to date and he even interviewed a State Trooper that investigated the accident.*  newlinechar  newlinechar Then as I'm about half way through the article this catches my eye: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Hager had been visiting his girlfriend in Fairfax County, Virginia, and had left her home at about 7:45 a.m. on the day of the crash. Later that day, Hager stopped at his father's home in Gloucester County. His father wasn't there at the time, but Hager did call him at about 12 p.m. newlinechar  newlinechar 7:45 am??? 12:00 pm???? I thought this accident happened at 1:30 am!!!!! All the information I saw prior to this article says 1:30 AM!!! Go back to the beginning of the article and read this: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's what police found at the crash scene on the afternoon of Monday, June 26, 1995,  newlinechar  newlinechar AFTERNOON????? What???? Wait a minute!!!  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Did you hear that???? That was the sound of my head exploding! newlinechar  newlinechar I think this one can be solved if everyone that is attempting to solve it is working with the same valid facts.     newlinechar  newlinechar I just joined WebSluths in hope of finding some accurate information on this case.

Chiming in here.  I actually worked on Poxnora as a designer for about 3 years, bridging between Octopi and SOE ownership.  The last part of your post, about power creep, is the biggest thing that will translate into hearthstone if Blizzard doesn't consider it early.   newlinechar  newlinechar The business models for this kind of game demand the release of new cards, they simply don't make much money otherwise.  In order to make the new cards desirable it is very difficult to avoid bringing up the baseline of power over time.  One of the large factors contributing to the decline of Poxnora's balance and fun was the requirement to keep all cards in circulation at once.  This makes it increasingly hard to create new cards without resorting to complex new effects or large combinations of existing effects. newlinechar  newlinechar I think Blizzard should strongly consider breaking the game up into limited play sets as time goes on, assuming they continue with a business model built around driving users to acquire the latest cards.

&gt; It's not so much a catastrophic polarization as it is a slow legitimation of what used to be an absolutely unacceptable agenda. newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair, isn't this sort of a matter of perspective?  The kind of moderate-ish ethnic nationalism you see out of much of the new populist right in Europe would have been 'mainstream' conservative thought a generation ago.  It's also interesting to me that people like Marine Le Pen and Timo Soini seem to be having a lot of success outflanking the traditional center left parties on economic issues.  Many of those parties moved away from the economic left the past 25 years and compensated with more aggressive social liberalism to differentiate themselves from the opposition.   newlinechar  newlinechar I would argue that much of the new support for the populist and far right in Europe is the result of them filling a vacuum the old parties left behind, not some new right wing trailblazing.  Add that to a bad economy stoking anti-establishment feelings and people are less willing to stay loyal to the mainstream parties.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell.

My argument would be his poor track record most seasons and his unwillingness to adjust his scheme for the players he has to work with. His defense was always predicated on a bend don't break mentality so there weren't a lot of blitzes. In 2011, it worked because we had an amazing line that could get pressure while only rushing 4. This year he should have blitzed more in my opinion because we weren't getting a ton of pressure rushing 4 which gave Qb's time to pick apart our depleted secondary. So while it wasn't his fault that we had a lot of injuries it was his fault that we didn't adjust our scheme to try and cover up those injuries. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, that's a solid username, have you ran it past Carol in HR?

Looked it up - looks interesting.  I never played Cities XL because when I heard about it, I heard the online MMO thing (I don't even know that I knew it had a single-player mode).  So I see that Skylines will be single-player, which is good.  I don't have Steam, but I know Banished was available without it; will the same be true for Skylines.  If it is, do you know if it will require a persistent Internet connection?
Even when you got better loot in Destiny, it just wasn't...fun. The guns didn't feel different or interesting, or change at all through the game.

completely unrelated to this announcement, beyond his method of communicating it.  More and more, I find myself disliking him as a person.  I like his books, Love his charity, but he kind of comes across as an asshole who thinks his farts don't stink (if you understand the phrase).  His foreword in 'Slow Regard for Silent Things', came across as someone saying that 'if you don't like this book, you just don't get it and aren't one of the cool kids'.  I follow him on twitter and he constantly says things on there that just come across as super douchey. For instance, he doesn't post that he thinks the new Hobbit movies suck, but that 'I'm trying really hard not to judge you folks who went to see the Hobbit movies.....'.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'll buy doors of stone whenever it comes out and I'll continue to support Worldbuilders as its a fantastic charity, but I'm just not really going to be a fan of his anymore.

My mom got me one, finally, after months of begging, for Christmas. A Diva cup.  newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair, it wasn't that hard a sell on my awesome hippie mom, but my dad wasn't at all reasonable and that's where the money came from. I would have got it (A Mooncup, actually, seems preferable, and the replacement in roughly ten years will be a MCUK) myself if I had a credit card and didn't find it insulting I have to pay for my necessities at 17.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was actually excited for my period. I'm using it right now, and it's fucking wonderful. It took me literally four hours to get it in the first time (I hadn't read the part about holding the fold *as low on the cup as possible*, and it kept popping open too soon), but I'm on the second day now and you can't feel it at all when you get it in right (admittedly I'm gonna need practice, there is *very* slight pressure when you do it wrong), no leaking (I slept naked last night! No diaper panties! No Japanese sheets! It was a fucking miracle!), and having a mL amount for just how little blood menstruation really is is really cool. newlinechar  newlinechar And not the 'you can't even feel a tampon!' lies.

Until you get it down pat, even the leaking is minimal, one of the liners you have left over will last the whole day. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I've read everything I can on them, and they truly are safe if used with proper care- washing your hands, cleaning it, and leaving it in the cool carrying bag that nobody would be 'haha you're gonna put it in your *vagina* ha ha nasty' in public at a glance, unlike a pad or tampon.

My little sisters' best friend, who I can say is generally a nice girl, vehemently told me not to dump it in the sink because 'I use that too', like it's any of her goddamn business what I do, and like it would affect her anyway. I can say fuck them and laugh, but I'm sorry to say some people *can't*. newlinechar  newlinechar TL:DR; I am a menstrual cup user and I think everyone should be given the option. They should be more widespread. This wasn't in any of my learning about sexual health even though it's the best.

I think it's really hard, because I didn't grow up with normal clothing.

Really most clothing that's not loose and untailored looks immodest to me. newlinechar  newlinechar And psychologically, I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty.  Like, I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest, even if she's more covered than many of her less well endowed sisters.  I feel like I get this from other women too - a lot of people assume I put a lot of work into my 'figure', maybe I'm wearing lots of padding or have implants, or that I'm on a diet and focused on my weight all the time.  And I feel like I don't look like a modest girl, because I'm very thin and have DD's, when most modest women I know don't look like that.

A lot of individuals (like me and you) don't agree. The MVP voters seem to have an understanding, though.

Basically, every single thing needs an Intelligence to be observing it at all times in order to keep it in a definite form and to direct it/keep it from dissolving back into quantum foam. newlinechar  newlinechar After an Intelligence has been active for a while (I originally wrote 'around for a while' but this is inaccurate, all Intelligences are eternal, but some just kind of sit around doing nothing while others explore their surroundings,) it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy, thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of Godhood. But the more you have influence over, the harder it is to observe every single individual particle. newlinechar  newlinechar So as you ascend in degrees of Godhood, you recruit other Intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you. As you evolve into a more and more complex entity, you recruit more and more Intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a spiritual evolution, each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution. You organize a more complex spiritual (spirit = plasma/electricity or something very similar) form, then incarnate into a solid form that matches it. After accruing experience in that solid form, you return to a purely spiritual form and take what you've learned (learning is much easier in a material form) and evolve your spiritual body (with or without help, see below,) then re-incarnate, taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form. newlinechar  newlinechar In addition to reincarnation, there is resurrection. newlinechar  newlinechar Resurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter. The best of both worlds, without the limitations. Once you reach this point, you are ready to take the next step, which is to assist other Intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies. newlinechar  newlinechar Resurrected beings can reproduce, and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own. They can re-organize spirits from lower forms too, for example a dog to a chimp. It's possible, though much more difficult, for an Intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body (JHVH did this, hence why He is called self-created.) Once an Intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way, it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state. newlinechar  newlinechar After creating spirit bodies, a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit. This is what Adam and Eve did. They voluntarily gave up their resurrected state, after populating the Earth with spirits, in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they (we) could experience the next step. newlinechar  newlinechar As Adam and Eve fell, so too did the Earth, from its former place of glory at the center of the Galaxy to its present position at the tip of the Orion spiral arm. Adam and Eve left the congregation of the Elohim (Hebrew word meaning the Gods, plural, not God, singular) to rejoin mortality for our benefit. Later, JHVH did the same, but whereas Adam and Eve fell to bring death on themselves, JHVH incarnated as the man Yeshua Ben Yusuf of Nazareth to bring eternal life on Adam and Eve and all their progeny. newlinechar  newlinechar The Egyptian religion depicts the spirits of sinners (those whose hearts are heavier than the feather of Maat) being fed to Ammit, the crocodile/lion/hippo goddess of chaos. Basically those whose choices have taken them to a moral dead-end are dissolved back into quantum foam to be recycled; this happens after they are given EVERY chance to take a better path.

Those look a lot like my first attempts too! newlinechar  newlinechar So, through trial and error I learned: newlinechar  newlinechar * Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.    newlinechar * Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails.  newlinechar * Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help. newlinechar * Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible. newlinechar * Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment.  newlinechar  newlinechar These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Welding cast is always a pain. The sand used in the casting process always manages to get into the base metal. The metal also has large pores that trap all sorts of crud like oil, grease, coolant, dirt, and who knows what else.  newlinechar  newlinechar You die-grind the area about to be welded and do a hot bead with medium filler, which will look like crap and full of crud and porosity. You then grind all that crap off, and weld again. You keep doing that til you get a GOOD full metal weld in. Then move forward to the next section of build-up and do that again, and again, and again, and again. newlinechar  newlinechar So you actually weld the same area sometimes 4-5 times buttering the base metal til you get good fusion and good metal. Then as you buildup some of the crud floating on the top of your previous bead will cause problems on the next bead, so you float it up to brush/grind it off. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a pain. Lots of wire brushes, lots of die grinding, lots of acetone. It's mostly in the prep work , the welding itself doesn't take very long.

You claim he just sat there with his kids, but if you watch the video he doesn't even know it happened until after people are hit by it.

&gt; What people didn't know about Blockbuster is that I was given free reign to simply forgive any amount of late charges. All you have to do is be nice and have a good excuse. Your kid rented a playstation with your card and didn't return it for 3 weeks? No sweat. Just bring it back and the $300 or so late charges are forgiven. That easy. Wanna be a mean sonofabitch? Well screw you pal. We'll just take it off your card. newlinechar &gt; Blockbuster's stance was that you get more money out of a returning customer than you would being hardline about late fees. Of course, we didn't advertise that... newlinechar &gt; (This pertains to the franchise I worked for. I don't know what the corporate stance would be) newlinechar  newlinechar Are you joking?  newlinechar  newlinechar You sound like you're talking up a policy of one of the most tragic companies in American history.

Particularly the policies of how they treated their customers. newlinechar  newlinechar You're not God as a Blockbuster manager. That's like being the captain on the titanic except about 1000 times less glamorous. If Blockbuster ever charged me for something (in a similar fashion how you claimed you could just write it off or forgive it), I'd simply call my credit card company and refuse the charge.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can guarantee you I wouldn't be paying your charge if I didn't want to, particularly if it's just an afterthought that you could dismiss randomly based on whether someone kissed your ass or not.  newlinechar  newlinechar Look, if the company was worth a shit, they'd still be around. They sucked. They clung to an outdated business model, they clung to outdated media and they refused to embrace technology until it was too late. On top of that EVERYONE HATED THEM.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know lots of people went to Blockbuster for a while but it was out of having no options rather than wanting to go. You do realize how a business like that is doomed to fail eventually, right?  newlinechar  newlinechar It was a miserable shitty company and policies like the one you just admitted to is part of the reason why people were celebrating when it went under. newlinechar  newlinechar Good riddance.
the editing was OK, the plays were fine, but anyone who watches the LCS has seen all of them. newlinechar  newlinechar However the video it self was VERY predictable based off of the music, framing, and filters you put on each scene. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah, sad music and greyscale.

There is a guy named Meb Faber who wrote a book called 'The Ivy Portfolio: How to Invest Like the Top Endowments and Avoid Bear Markets.' newlinechar  newlinechar In his book, Faber describes the thinking behind the approach taken by the endowments of many large universities. The endowments are run by reasonable and thoughtful people, and this is reflected in their approach to investing. One key to this approach is diversification across multiple asset classes. The strategy is presented in a straightforward manner, and the book offers some good 'how to' tips, and is also well written and very accessible to the layman. Good luck with it.

No adjustments newlinechar  newlinechar The other team adjusts to us. I was watching the Pacers broadcast and their coach said they will stop out paint points (and they did... 6 paint points in 2nd half), tighten up their D, and some other stuff newlinechar  newlinechar But we just don't adjust. Spo I know says 'KEEP IT UP GUYS!' without changing anything. newlinechar  newlinechar He doesn't play Whiteside a lot in the 2nd half for some reason, and we look our best with Whiteside IN.  newlinechar  newlinechar Rio-Cole come in, and we lose leads. Cole comes in when game is tied, Pacers go on 24-7 lead. newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at the box score, the guard differential is astounding. The fact that Miles scored more than Wade (who guarded him) didn't help, Hill outplayed both Cole and Rio. Then Watson with his 11 points (Rio-Cole COMBINED) don't help. Also RIo-Cole 8 turn overs this game... EIGHT!!! newlinechar  newlinechar Our offense also goes to shit as you can see Bosh talking about it. We lack play making abilities besides Wade. newlinechar  newlinechar I think to fix our situation, Wade needs to be our PG, move Rio to SG. In the beginning of the year the Heat experimented to Bazz-Rio back court AND IT WORKED!

&gt; I see, I think I would like it as long as they don't make Hans the main villain of the show or something, in all honestly if they did a spin off I would prefer if they mostly left Hans aside. He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job. newlinechar  newlinechar I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times. newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming. newlinechar  newlinechar I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.

That brings up an interesting question. More likely than not, there are association footballers, track stars, people living in deserted African or Siberian villages who have the potential (numbers and intangibles) to start at some position in the NFL. newlinechar  newlinechar There are 32 starting NFL quarterbacks coming from a pool of 316.1 million. That means that in the US, there is one starting quarterback per  9,878,125 people. There are 7 billion people in the world, or 708 (rounding down) NFL starting caliber guys in the world. Subtract 32 (for those already on NFL rosters) and that's 676 who mathematically could start right now for a franchise. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to find just ONE of those guys before Sunday.

Yes: I am strongly disagreeing with that 'point'. I most strongly disagree that 'a phone meeting with... a dozen other members of the ... team' is not one of the most efficient ways to quickly track down a one-off bug involving time-zone/date shenanigans that may involve user environment wrinkles that may require the test machine to be quickly reset for another 'clean' pass at the problem.  You get to keep working and tracking down the issue while talking with the team: **this is a hyper-efficient approach to the problem**. newlinechar  newlinechar If someone comes into my office for an interview and says that this is not an efficient approach for a hot high-priority issue, I have grave concerns about that person.  Maybe you can provide an alternative better solution for 'each team member working directly on diagnosing and fixing their share of the problem while maintaining an instant line of multiway communication', but it's still excellent.  And someone having bad meetings at their company doesn't invalidate what was clearly and demonstrably a productive meeting here. newlinechar  newlinechar We can get into the meta of it sucking for MTGO to have high priority issues on a regular basis, but from a development and test perspective the response was bang-up and the criticism unfair and unfounded.

In all seriousness this is probably the best answer so far. newlinechar  newlinechar Curry would be the best ball handler and playmaker LeBron has ever played with, significantly reducing the play making responsibilities on LeBron's part.

I really feel like this shouldn't all be put on the OP. The roommate should also be held accountable for leaving her puppy unattended. Obviously no one expects something like this to happen, but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). If the roommate wasn't watching the puppy, the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items, going potty inside, etc). Similarly, OP should have crated his own dog if he knew Charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault, but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated. Should he help out with bills? Probably, yeah. But should he feel obligated to foot 100% of the expenses? I really don't think so.

This I think is what a lot of ppl advocating for horizontal progression forget, ultimately a vast swath of the community is gonna decide on the small handful of efficent builds and anyone who isn't running one of those is gonna get vote kicked from any duty/party finder they join. Horizontal progression is great on paper and opens up a lot of choices but unless each fight is dramatically tuned to effectively give different weights to different abilities, a couple sets will just eclipse the rest. Hell even the small amount of fights that might manage to pull it off will probably just frustrate the larger playerbase 'great i need a specific gear set or else no one wants me to join their X farming party better leave all that garbage on my retainer' etc. 
I don't think it's always a bad plan. They sound like classes for students looking to major in math so that they develop familiarly with mathematical rigor. To my understanding they are to be taken instead of the courses designed for use by all departments and in place of calculus requirements.

Again this was done with special consideration for the blind. There are no two coins that are similar in size and have the same kind of edge.

The only way any college team would even have a prayer is if we are going with historical best/worst teams. newlinechar  newlinechar So... how about the [2001 Miami Hurricanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team#Starting_lineup) VS the [2000 San Diego Chargers](http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/san-diego-chargers/roster/2000?sort=pos). I would have picked the only 0-16 team, the 2008 Lions, but I feel like all they'd need to do is air it up to Megatron against a college team and they'd be putting points up. newlinechar  newlinechar This Chargers team? They've got Seau and Rodney Harrison on D and as far as I can tell everyone else on the roster is either unknown or known to be terrible. I feel like the Canes would at least have a chance with... Clinton Portis, Jeremy Shockey, Andre Johnson, Najeh Davenport and 4 offensive lineman that went on to play in the NFL(with the other starter having a career in the CFL). On Defense, every single starter except for 1 went on to play in the NFL, most of them being high draft picks. newlinechar  newlinechar If we could time travel these 2 teams to the Rose Bowl to play against each other with, say 2 weeks to prepare for the game... I really think it's at least a 50/50 shot for Miami to wint, if not in their favor.

I'm not trying to piss you off and I apologize if you've taken my comments that way.

Except this wasn't an 'illegal' stop. Cops can pull you over at their own discretion. They don't need evidence or to prove probable cause. A traffic stop is not an arrest. If the cop tried to detain you for an unreasonable amount of time, or if he'd searched without permissions or a warrant, then that would be illegal, but the stop itself wasn't illegal, nor was searching with permission.

Considering how desperate Princess Anna was and how susceptible she was to one magical, romantic evening, Prince Hans could bank on the princess falling into the arms of the closest and only remaining loved one and the two would be dashing off to the altar. Princess Anna would be too heartbroken to place blame on anybody, yet alone her fiance who would have no blood on his hands; such a death would be out of his hands and I would think Princess Anna would later accept that it was for the best.

America has 99 Cents Only stores and Dollar Tree.

In Letters, Tolkien, talking about a hypothetical occurring when the Ring is at Mount Doom, uses the term 'the Eight', mentioning that the 'Witch-king had been reduced to impotence'. He has been killed, but beyond that he has been laid so low as to be irrelevant from then on. However, it can be argued that being killed didn't release him from the power of the Rings, so he should still be around. He shouldn't find the natural progression of Man into Death until after the destruction of the Ring (some people argue not even then, but I strongly disagree). newlinechar  newlinechar The passage the two of you were talking about, I think, is enough. We don't need to look to other books, just to previous paragraphs. This is actually the second wraith in so many pages to pass above the Hobbits. However, the first incident (where, the clouds still thick, there is no visual description) seems to take some time. Frodo and Sam are described as crouching under a boulder and not speaking for some time, until Frodo finally senses it has passed. Before they start moving again, Theoden is stated to be at that moment dying.  newlinechar  newlinechar With the second passage, the whole scene, a transit from far away . Perhaps a long pause, but still just that, with no indication by the author that any great deal of time has passed, like in the first Nazgul's flight. Even seeing it before they feel it (as was the only indication of the first), there's a speed that marks it as something different. The second passage ends with the statement that the Lord of the Nazgul is dead, and from the pronouncement appears to be making the same sort of claim of immediacy as it did with Theoden. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that, I lean more towards his interpretation. But I'm not going to say it couldn't be one of the other Nazgul flying like a bat out of hell to report. There's simply too much attention drawn to it for me to think we are witnessing anything left than the death-visage of Lord of the Nazgul.

You started this game after the new mechanics have been added. That adds a much steeper learning curve than most of us who started earlier. Tip: Download iZurvive and make sure you have a compass in game that is worn or pristine. (Look in fire stations). On iZurvive make a waypoint where you are and where you want to go. The correspond line will give you and ETA and it will give you a directional degree between 1 and 359. Then pull up your compass and line up in that degree. Once lined up double tap alt so you can lock your camera and auto run until said destination. PM for help if needed

If it makes you feel better, there have been times when I have been completely drunk and said things that I would never in a hundred years have every thought to say!! And the next morning, I wouldn't even remember. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, when I first started dating my boyfriend, his mom got into an accident and he was really worried about her. I was also worried about her since my boyfriend seemed so distressed about it. But for some reason, after I was really drunk one night, I told him that I didn't believe that she was really that hurt and he ended up having to convince me by showing me a picture of her in the hospital. newlinechar  newlinechar The next morning, when he told me what I said, I was mortified! There was never a point when I doubted that his mom was hurt!! **I am so happy he told me I said that though so I could profusely apologize.** newlinechar  newlinechar So, at least in my experience, sometimes alcohol can make people say craaazy, absurd things that end up being hurtful.

I didn't say anything about present day dungeons in what you were responding to (despite me believing that).  I said 2.0 runs.  My initial post said they destroy them in speed runs, which they do from what I've seen.  If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops). newlinechar  newlinechar And while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.

So, let me put it to you this way... right now, you're looking at a high-end overclockable CPU (which you're spending extra for, by the way, without buying a cooler!?), and to go along with that you're buying a shit low-end video card. So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams. newlinechar  newlinechar Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it. newlinechar  newlinechar If your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. You don't need to sacrifice a quad-core processor, just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch, it doesn't fit the rest of your specs. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway... good luck.

If the blower motor is starting before the flame even lights, then there is an issue.

If the blower doesn't start in about 2-3 minutes, then the limit will reach temperature and kick the flame out.

Okay, I think I know what bothers me about Yas's W and passive. newlinechar  newlinechar Yasuo's passive, Q, E, and R *all* create the cohesive image that he interacts with disturbances in air currents. newlinechar  newlinechar His passive gives the sense that 'Flow' is something that can be acquired and disrupted, right?  He gets Flow, and protective wind surrounds him indefinitely until his flow is disrupted, at which point it becomes turbulent, and dissipates shortly afterward.  How does it work?  I don't know, but I feel like, by moving through the air, he can sense what it's doing and sort of 'fit into' it, and that's what creates the normally-invisible shield.  When it's disrupted, he exploits that disruption to prevent damage to himself. newlinechar  newlinechar When Yasuo uses Q, he's also doing *something* with air currents, because it takes 2 of them before he's ready to use the tornado with his third.  Maybe he's reading the currents with his first 2 stabs, maybe he's priming the air (so more writing than reading) with them.  It makes sense, because something changes if he doesn't use the conditions that he's created within a few seconds: all of the prep work goes away, fickle as the wind.  If Yasuo stabs again, though, he can exploit some created or detected disruption in the air to create his tornado, similar to what he does when creating his shield. newlinechar  newlinechar Yasuo's E is a bit more proactive, in that, instead of exploiting an existing disturbance in the air, he forcibly creates one, and that prevents him from using the ability again.  He enhances his movement speed by slipping through the air *just so*, but can't do it again for a certain amount of time because he's changed the air he moved through.  This is why he can E again and again, as long as he has an air current he hasn't already disturbed: the limit isn't with Yasuo, but in the time it takes the air he's disturbing with his dash to return to normal. newlinechar  newlinechar What's more, while this disturbance is being created, Yasuo can exploit it: he can perform sword maneuvers that are beyond his normal abilities (the spin), and create a significantly-larger-than-normal tornado, though it doesn't travel. newlinechar  newlinechar When Yasuo's ult is ready, displacement effects give clear visual queue that they're creating, you guessed it, a disruption in the air that Yasuo can, you guessed it, exploit to benefit himself, this time in the form of extremely rapid movement (presumably aided by the disruption in the air), suspending his enemies in the air, and finally, gaining armor penetration, represented by a disturbance in the air around his sword.  There's a disturbance in the air; Yasuo exploits it. newlinechar  newlinechar His W is the only thing that doesn't fit.  While his E also forcibly manipulates air, it retains his common theme: he can use that disruption to benefit himself (enhanced Q) in some way.  With his W, however, he creates the disturbance and that's it, end of story.  He can't interact with it in any other way, and it's the only air-based ability in the game that he can't interact with (unless you count Janna's shield). newlinechar  newlinechar **TL;DR: Yasuo exploits and interacts with air disturbances, except the one created with his own W.**

Round 1 I would give to Azula 6/10, assuming Pikachu is taking orders from Ash, the lag between them would give her a big lead and make their attacks predictable. Pikachu has no special resistance to fire, and I'm sure Azula wouldn't be dumb enough to use lighting against Pikachu more than once newlinechar  newlinechar Round 2 though I would give to Pikachu 9/10. If Azula decided to take Ash out or even just accidentally burned him, Pikachu can be a crazy powerhouse and probably wouldn't have too much trouble getting around her attacks without Ash shouting out exactly what to do.

That coming to PS4 made my day; it's one of my favourite games this year.

This is an amusing post; and I feel like a lot of people making similar posts about ED on here these days would do well to look back on that.  :p    newlinechar  newlinechar Back in those days, it took me something like a day of playing to complete my first successful flight from lave to another system, including docking.  But once I did it once, then it started getting *a lot* easier.   But you had to work to earn that sense of accomplishment.  It was *hard*, and so you really earned the satisfaction of even that simple achievement.   newlinechar  newlinechar And at that point, a whole galaxy...eight of them, actually...opened up before me.   And I was hooked;  I didn't stop until I made *ELITE*.    I was a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a pirate, a pawn and a theif, and occasionally even an honest trader.  I would do the Reidquat run as a warm-up, and then look for a *really* dangerous system to hunt in.  Basically, I practiced until I was actually good at it, instead of quitting just because some feel-good sense of 'winning' wasn't handed to me on a platter like games of today do.   newlinechar  newlinechar Back then games required real skill, and if you couldn't cut it, you lost the game, period.    And a little imagination helped, too; wireframe, or simple solid-colour polygons give you a canvas, and your mind had to fill in the details.   That is not really encouraged as much in the big games of today.    newlinechar  newlinechar And for God's sake, if I see another post about how Elite is bad and should be more like WoW or Eve, I am just going to have to murder someone.   IF you think either of those things, it simply isn't the game for you, you know?    newlinechar  newlinechar I wonder if any  other old-timers are kicking it in Bebece these days?  Is that system even in ED?  I guess I'll have to take a look.   newlinechar  newlinechar

The more possible passwords you have, the harder it is to guess. You can measure that as bits of entropy, the amount of bits (1s and 0s) you'd need to store every possibility. newlinechar  newlinechar Assuming a completely random string that uses any printable ASCII characters, each new character adds 6.570 bits of entropy. With 18 characters the OP mentions, that's 118.26 bits of entropy, which the OP feels isn't enough - he wants to add more characters to the mix, increasing the number of possibilities and thus the 'value' of each character, so to speak.  newlinechar  newlinechar For comparisons sake, according to an estimate made in 2011, 72 bits of entropy would take well over a hundred years to guess, and it gets exponentially more difficult the more bits you add. 118.26 bits should be more than enough for anyone's needs. newlinechar  newlinechar I totally cheated and used wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: Special characters will make your password safer, but you don't really have to worry about it unless you're a cryptography enthusiast.   newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: I copied a value incorrectly, 118.26 became 187.26. Don't ask how ;_;

Maybe it's trivially easy to find men because... the man doesn't have to carry the child inside of him? newlinechar  newlinechar Like, look. I have admitted that it's 'unfair' that biology 'privileges' women by burdening them with a nine-month pregnancy. Both parents have the same options most of the time: Don't have sex if you don't want a pregnancy to ensue. Give the child up for adoption if you don't want to raise it, and pay child support if the other parent raises it. newlinechar  newlinechar But only women (and a very, very small number of men) have to actually deal with being pregnant, and because women are the ones who get pregnant, women are the ones who decide whether or not the pregnancy continues. This is because it is completely unfair to make a woman carry a fetus to term if she doesn't want to, and it's equally unfair to subject her to abortion (an invasive medical procedure) without her consent. newlinechar  newlinechar If cis men could get pregnant, they would have all the same options here. MRAs constantly talk about how it's 'just biology' that's to blame for women earning less money, getting raped, or whatever other injustices women have to deal with. But men face one single problem that literally *is* because of biology, and that's horrendously unfair? Get real. newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, my mother actually has told me stories of pregnant single teens who had their children taken and raised by their parents, who later had to pay child support to their own parents (the children's grandparents) when it came to light, but I'm not actually submitting that as an example because it's hearsay and none of those keywords lead to anything useful on Google. (Because most of the results are just men whining about having to pay child support.) newlinechar  newlinechar If I can magically find an example in this cesspit of 'but whyyyyyyy do i have to take responsibility for my actions???' (in b4 'but abortion' - abortion is a valid way of taking responsibility, it's not the 'easy way out' that conservatives like to pretend it is) then I'll come back and link you. But otherwise, I'm done here.

&gt; Technically the item was charged to them while it was still in their possession. newlinechar  newlinechar LOL, you don't understand how banks and credit cards work.

You guys seem bummed that it went out of business but it was HORRIBLE. And all of these policies you guys are defending is a huge part of why people were celebrating when the chain fell apart. newlinechar  newlinechar I denied a claim from a Blockbuster through American Express once.

&gt;So then they fight the French some more, and then they fight the Americans some more, and at some point human nature is what it is. It's not an argument against anything. It's what happens when people are too far gone. newlinechar  newlinechar except that isn't what it is.  the vietnamese could only keep fighting because they were were being supplied with modern arms by the russians and chinese.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Post-colonial Taiwan was barely a thing, before it turned into the safe haven for the KMT. newlinechar  newlinechar post colonial anything is barely a thing, it's a political slogan not a meaningful state of being. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And I think a lot of their modern positions are the result of their having been on the right side of the winning side, and developing those trade links and investment pipelines. newlinechar  newlinechar their modern positions largely pre-date the end of the cold war, but even if they didn't, the argument 'links to the west are good for development' is hardly one in favor of leftist agitation.  the USSR gave out tons of aid to its satellites, military and economic.  It achieved little because communism doesn't work and capitalism does.  
You've probably already tried, but have you asked them to do a once weekly grocery list, checking everything you currently have before putting anything on the list? I'd also suggest collecting their receipts and totally their monthly expenses. If you have more time, I'd suggest listing everything you throw out early, and coming up with a value based on what is left, putting everything in an excel spreadsheet, and showing them how wasteful they are. That's basically a second job though.

Amen. I've always had nerves with new partners, not for any particular reason it's just something I can't get over. The current girl I'm seeing made me feel really comfortable, she was patient, and as soon as I was shown some compassion for my feelings and not treated like I was a tool to get her off all those nerves went away. I think the problem I have is that I see sex as 80% for her and 20% for me, I always feel pressure to make sure I get her off before I worry about myself.

Can't comment on Anderson's defense as 61.7% is pretty bad but he's also on an oddly poor defensive team considering they have Asik and Davis as shotblockers. I'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. Stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with. newlinechar  newlinechar On offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. He's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. Montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat Anderson is. Montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had. newlinechar  newlinechar You also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. Stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... Dwight (Lewis in Orlando). It's also been a noticeable part of offense for the Spurs (Matt Bonner) and Suns (formerly Channing Frye) in the past. If Houston had the opportunity to trade Montiejunas for Anderson straight up Morey would have Montiejunas on the plane to New Orleans in a heartbeat.

Actually, the video itself is the context, the word you were no doubt searching for is there is no proof, or other conclusive evidence to suggest that the white kid is the bully. However, using context clues, one can make some general assumptions. For instance, the black kid's behavior does suggest that he is distressed, and taking into account the standoffish nature of the white kid, especially at the end when he tries to save face, not to mention the reaction of the other people present, which is obviously supportive of the black kid, it is not outside the bounds of reason to assume that the kid was indeed being bullied and responded in an appropriate and satisfying manner. Of course, it is impossible to be sure that the above mentioned scenario is the correct one, but I posit that it is probably the most likely of the other available explanations.

My advice to not wasting time and money on square bitches is to focus on bitches that like YOU rather than bitches that you like. As soon as you've made a connection with them, profess your feelings for them first. If they get all gushy over you telling them that you feel a strong connection with them, then pull back a bit and get them to chase you. On the other hand if you tell them you feel a strong connection and they're like 'yeah whatever BUY ME SOMETHING' then you know they're trying to get you to chase them and most of the time, no matter how fine the bitch is, it won't work between you. newlinechar  newlinechar If you play things too slow waiting for them to build up a connection with you, it's a hit or miss game and you can lose a lot of time and money in the process. On the other hand, as soon as you feel you've put in a bit of quality time, if you right away tell them you feel that strong connection, you'll probably end up losing a large amount of your prospects in the process, but at the end of the day you're weeding out the ones that are too much trouble or effort in the first place. 
I'm far from these people when it comes to this story. I just can't understand this Transgender stuff. I just think if you got a dick you're a guy and if you have a vagina you're a girl.

I apologize if this infuriates anybody but if i hear someone who looks just like a girl say 'I was born a guy' I'm gonna feel like I was fooled.

Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language -- so the argument runs -- must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.

Considering pretty much every civilization over thousands of years has had something against the Jews, it makes you wonder what the hell they do to piss people off so much.  Hell, the reason they've become so associated with money handling is because in the middle ages, the church didn't let Christians lend money with interest, so they **forced** all the Jews to get into that line of work.

I don't know why but this feels like the least flattering recommendation I have read in a long time. Don't get me wrong, *Learn You a Haskell* may be *the* way to go. I am concerned for the lack of exercises to accompany it, though. Additionally, and I know this may just be pickiness over the style, I feel like it 'tries too hard' to be funny. Some days I don't mind attempts to be funny. Other days, I just want to get right to the point. Plus, if I recall correctly, didn't someone recently criticize *Learn You a Haskell*'s english style as 'broken to the point of unreadable'? Or am I thinking of something else?

His TARDIS will be a major advantage. newlinechar  newlinechar **Superman**, the guy who can benchpress planets, heat vision, freeze breath, sun-dipping, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar **Thor**, Norse god of thunder and wielder of Mjolnir.

Alright. newlinechar Then why are you complaining about the heavy doing that? If he was messing around, and if it was a pub, then it's all cool isn't it? Never questioned your intellectual level, only questioned how good of a medic you are. newlinechar  newlinechar It is. You obviously don't have enough experience to even start comparing the medi gun to the quickfix. You can still defend with an uber, krtiz can be more agro, the vaccinator goes along well depending on the enemy specifically. The QF, on the other hand, is just an all around medi gun. Good medics don't keep everyone alive lmao, you're talking about nice medics. Good medics have heal priority, who to give up to achieve an objective, capture a point, who to uber, when, knowing your way out, countless are the things that make you a good medic. I could write a book with such things. newlinechar  newlinechar In a serious environment where you can communicate with your team, the QF is utter trash and shouldn't even be used if the enemy aren't braindead. Enemy spy can check your medi gun and tell the medic who will proceed on to pick kritzkrieg. A kritz demo makes the QF's uber a joke. newlinechar You can hold off enemies with stock as well, if you have good mobility, positioning, surviving should not be an issue. As I said you can't keep everyone alive as a medic, you have to take the right decisions, and this is what makes medic a jewel, you're not there to keep everyone alive hurr durr i iz gud medic, no. A good medic paired with decent players can be devastating. If your team is shit, and if you always play with braindead players, then I feel sorry. But since I know you don't, and that the QF can be replaced at really any moment with the medi gun IF you have an ounce of gamesense, then you should use it. newlinechar  newlinechar Look, pal, it ain't that hard to keep people alive. I've had to keep at multiple times up to 5 players alive all at once, you just have to keep healing priority in mind. It's not rocket science, and IMO using the QF overall is an excuse because you're justifying your lack of skill as a medic to compensate for mobility, positioning, and not being able to accept mistakes you'd make with the medi gun.

&gt; Sure they do. newlinechar  newlinechar No they aren't. Not even light works the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. newlinechar  newlinechar What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.
sorry for the late thread guys
I know 6-7 teams can still make bowls.  Not sure if Colorado would get the exemption though.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  Found the rules for what to do after all normal eligible schools have been taken. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  Teams finishing 6-6 with one win against a team from the lower Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), regardless of whether that FCS school meets NCAA scholarship requirements. Until now, an FCS win counted only if that opponent met the scholarship requirements—specifically, that school had to award at least 90% of the FCS maximum of 63 scholarship equivalents over a two-year period. In the 2012 season, programs in four FCS conferences cannot meet the 90% requirement (56.7 equivalents)—the Ivy League, which prohibits all athletic scholarships; the Patriot League and Pioneer Football League, which do not currently award football scholarships; and the Northeast Conference, which limits football scholarships to 38 equivalents. newlinechar  newlinechar 2.  6-6 teams with two wins over FCS schools. newlinechar  newlinechar 3.  Teams that finish 6-7 with loss number seven in their conference championship game (that has been eliminated by the conference championship waiver rule). newlinechar  newlinechar 4.  **6-7 teams that normally play a 13-team schedule, such as Hawaii's home opponents.** newlinechar  newlinechar 5.  FCS teams who are in the final year of the two-year FBS transition process, if they have at least a 6-6 record. newlinechar  newlinechar 6.  Finally, 5-7 teams that have a top-5 Academic Progress Rate (APR) score. This was later adjusted to allow other 5-7 teams to be selected thereafter—in order of their APR. [11] newlinechar

I really appreciate this article, and I really empathized with the author when he talked about the 'hidden code' of liturgy. newlinechar  newlinechar In my lifetime, both as a child and an adult, I have visited about 50 churches.  If the order of worship is not A: spelled out in the bulletin/pamphlet, or B: clearly enunciated by the pastor, it is very easy to become lost.  And, if you make any misstep, you feel self-conscious and left out. newlinechar  newlinechar I think many churches, both reformed and unreformed, use this habitual, 'hidden code' liturgy as a way for the congregation to bond over this shared, undefined habit, i.e. who's 'in the know'.  To me, this is almost gnostic, and serves to create a feeling of insiders vs. outsiders. newlinechar  newlinechar The congregation should be able to bond over their shared love of Christ, not who can memorize and perform the public 'secret handshake' ritual in absolute silence. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I really appreciate the author's gentleness when he spoke of his colleagues who made some very racist statements.  'African-Americans don't want liturgy, they want to be free to express themselves' comes across as imagining all black churches to be lead by James Brown, and all singing and dancing to resemble 'Soul Train'. newlinechar  newlinechar The author has taken the high road and wrote a series of informative articles, and I appreciate his work.  Thanks for posting this, all 5 parts were a great read!

Generally honesty and rationality will ensure you have a good kick starter. newlinechar  newlinechar Here are some questions you should ask. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Are you trying to scam people? newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Are you deceptive or dishonest in any way when selling your idea? newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Is your idea realistic? newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Do you have a plan on how you are going to spend the funds? newlinechar  newlinechar 5) Do you have a prototype that properly demonstrates that your idea is feasible, or a well elaborated and supported theoretical basis for your idea? newlinechar  newlinechar 6) Are your rewards realistic and fair?

I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema. newlinechar  newlinechar But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises). newlinechar  newlinechar I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I mean, #3 'Creating Worker Co-ops' is kind of socialist. Not really fully socialist, since he's not talking about seizing the present economic structures but building competing ones, but bringing workers' ownership into the conversation is helpful. And the way #4 'Growing the Trade Union Movement' is described certainly isn't socialist, but the labor movement will be critically important in any future socialist movement, so strengthening it is important. And while #7 may be named 'Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers,' the upswing of fighting the NAFTA or TPP (even for nationalistic reasons) would be a benefit to global workers in sectors that would be marginalized by the kind of free trade that is implemented on capital-owners' terms. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I see it, Bernie Sanders certainly isn't the answer. He's still quasi-capitalist and supports some imperialist policies. If he runs with the Democrats, he'll be telling people that 'socialism' is a thing for liberals and that the right-wing Democratic Party is the place for 'socialists,' which will do a lot of damage. But if he runs in a socialist party, he can help build up a movement that will outlive him. He won't be around forever, and if he's used to make a socialist movement more popular, it can be taken over by genuine socialists. Sanders and Kshama Sawant have spoken together in the past, and as maybe the next most prominent socialist in government (though distant by comparison), she might be indicative of what the next generation of such a movement would look like. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't trust Sanders to be president. He would probably be better than a Democrat or Republican, but I don't play the game of arguing for lesser evils. However, I do think that socialists can use him to bolster the movement, so long as he's got enough of his old socialist conscience left to not enter the Democratic Party.

Haha! My personal motto is 'Nobody ever looks back on their life and thinks, 'I wish I'd had less sex'.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately 20 is a *bit* too young for me, otherwise I'd take you up on your generous offer. :) newlinechar  newlinechar So, I didn't go to school, and it hasn't been a hindrance for me. I figured with the 50k I'd spend on school, not counting the insane amounts of interest, I could get a head start on my investment portfolio. Fortunately for me I was right.  newlinechar  newlinechar It also helps to be able to write and speak legibly: I'm a true believer that the gift of gab is worth its weight in gold. If you can speak to people in a manner they enjoy, the world opens up, regardless of the letters behind your name.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, I'm not *against* school, and especially if you live in a country that pays for it, by all means, continue your education. And you're right, a business degree seems like a good choice. Truth be told I was never much good at school (it's hard for me to sit still and concentrate), so it was an easy choice for me to put my money elsewhere.  newlinechar  newlinechar YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T HAVE TO END UP IN A BORING OFFICE JOB! There are plenty of people who enjoy the solace and anonymity provided by an office job - leave those jobs to the people who love them. Because if you don't, and if you would be miserable in such, then for fucks sake, don't do that to yourself. Even if you have a tough time finding a job - and believe me, I've been there - find something else with which to make money while you search. There are an infinite amount of ways to make cash, and the more you cultivate those, the better you get/the more money you make. For instance, I have flipped furniture, painted, sold things on ebay/craigslist, guest bartended ... really, there are so many things you can do to make money. The notion of 'The American way is to get a job in your twenties and work the same job until you're 65 and get your pension and live in your little house with your little wife until you die' are over, man. We live in a society that now embraces creativity (which they should, as all invention comes from creative thought), and there's so much out there that's just ripe for the taking. Yes, you have to work hard. Yes, you have to sacrifice. And for fuck's sake, be on time to things - tardiness is a sure way to get the boot.  newlinechar  newlinechar

My understanding is that simple carbs have low nutritional value and because you are missing out on the vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, antioxidants etc. is why it is unhealthy for you. newlinechar  newlinechar Specifically talking about the pancreas, I believe sugar does not lead to diabetes (according to my nutrition text book), but is often associated with obesity (which is associated with a lack of physical activity) which can increase the risk of developing diabetes. newlinechar  newlinechar What type of damage does refined carbs cause over time?

That was a really interesting article, thanks for sharing. One of the things that turned me away from Christianity were the bible readings we had every week at church. I just remember hearing some of these stories like where everyone in Sodom is killed as if every last person (including, I assume, infants) is deserving of death. Then Jesus comes along and all of a sudden we're all supposed to love each other.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know enough about biblical scholarship to debate some of the comments. But I find the argument interesting that the bible is our most historical document as we have so many copies. I've often heard that as an argument for the bible's infallibility. What I don't understand is how that in any way solves all the inconsistencies and contradictions within the bible itself.

&gt; We were remarking on how all new builds are so big and how it's so weird newlinechar  newlinechar Exactly. Ours is a 'starter home' and yet it's 1200 ft^2 , with an unfinished basement and a 3 stall garage. This is the only home we plan on living in now. Apparently, we'll be having new neighbors constantly since we're just in a 'starter' neighborhood. Ridiculous. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My husband and I live in a mass produced 'cracker box' very much like the first picture. It's about 1100 square feet, built in the early 50s and solid as a tank. newlinechar  newlinechar I love these neighborhoods, and am jealous of you. We tried to put offers on a couple of the houses like these that were in decent shape, but they were sold literally hours after being on the market. You're correct in that these houses are in high demand. The weird part is that in some of these neighborhoods, people seem to be buying the houses to use as rental properties - and the quality of neighborhoods seem to be going downhill because of it. I would LOVE to see newer neighborhoods with these houses. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;When we first moved in here, we had the typical 'starter home' mentality, figuring we'd upgrade in five to ten years. We only have one bathroom, and while we have four bedrooms, they're small, and their number comes at the expense of a dining room and a living room that can comfortably fit more than us and a few friends. newlinechar  newlinechar Our newer house does have some advantages: newlinechar  newlinechar The basement has a large family room, so that when it's finished, it can fit all of our 'activities' - Our 8 ft. pool table, a gaming/board game table and chairs/couch, and my gun safe. We have those items in the basement right now, it just isn't finished off.  newlinechar  newlinechar The 3rd stall in the garage will be my shop/woodworking area, so all the tools I have from my grandpa will actually be usable. With the small cracker box house neighborhoods, I've never seen more than a double stall, and most of them are single stalls; We want a garden as well, and a lot of the older neighborhoods have a pretty small lot size already. newlinechar  newlinechar When the basement is entirely finished off, we will have 2 more bedrooms and a 3rd bathroom. So, it'll be a 4 bedroom, 3 bath, dedicated laundry room 'starter home'. Still blows my mind that people think they need more than this. I can even use one of the basement bedrooms for a home office if I decide to quit working for someone else. We'll see what happens.  newlinechar  newlinechar ----------------------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar On a side note, 2 of the people that are married that my SO and I went to school with are looking at houses now. They're looking at a $450,000 house, 'but aren't sure it's big enough'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Makes me want to throat punch them.

&gt;Nobody should be forced into parental obligations for a child they never wanted. newlinechar  newlinechar So neither should taxpayers, who by all accounts had absolutely nothing to do with the birth of child at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;All people should be forced to pay taxes that fund a great many things, one of which would be a greater social safety net for childre. newlinechar  newlinechar Why shouldn't taxes be opt-in? All I'm pointing out is that you're being exceptionally inconsistent with how and where you apply the principle which forms the basis for your argument. It stands to reason that if I shouldn't have to pay for a child I never wanted, that extends to taxes that pay for said child. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But take a couple who agrees they don't want kids. They have consensual sex but the condom breaks, or birth control fails. The woman decides to raise the child, but the man does not want to be a parent. newlinechar  newlinechar And thems the breaks, I'm sorry to say. Life isn't always fair, nor does it always go according to plan. That you don't get to live the life you wanted isn't necessarily an indication that you're being treated unjustly.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;He should not be forced to pay. newlinechar  newlinechar Why not? Is it not his biological offspring? Why should I be forced to pay for his child if I have to opt-in for paying for children? newlinechar  newlinechar My point, again, isn't that it's a bad thing. I forward it. My point is that switching to an 'opt-in system' changes almost everything around our society and can be used just as easily to argue that I, as a taxpayer, shouldn't have to pay for that child. You haven't demonstrated why the principle only applies to cases that you want it to apply to, but not to others.

Actually a common misconception about cats is that throwing up is normal for them. It's not. I have a 7 year old cat and a 3 year old cat, they never ever throw up. The older one threw up once, and we knew something was seriously wrong, so we rushed her to the kitty hospital at like 3am, and it turns out she had eaten Lilies (the flower). If you didnt know, lily flowers are so toxic to felines that even just the pollen on their fur could result in renal failure. (It reacts to their bodies the same way that antifreeze does). She ended up being fine, but only because we caught it so early and didn't brush it off as 'oh must be a hairball'. After the first two hours of lily poisoning the survival rate goes down to 20%. But I digress, vomiting in cats is not normal. Yes some cats have hairballs, but they really aren't *supposed* to. There are simple home remedies, and food types for them that will stop hairballs. Anyway moral of the story is, if your cat throws up, don't just assume that cats do that- make sure that kitty is alright!

I feel like Netflix series fit street level heroes better than normal films. They don't require as many special effects and they also have a longer amount of time to develop the characters. newlinechar  newlinechar If the MCU does get ahold of Spidey, it would be interesting to get a Netflix series instead of an actual film for him.

I'm saying that I think the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the first team is greater than the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the second team.

But really, Vader/Dumbledore is a wash, Zeus is probably stronger than Thor, and like I said, Galdalf is just a beast and could probably negate The Doctor using the TARDIS.

I'm white and I live in Canada. I've never called 911 in my life, never filed a police report, and never been detained by the police. newlinechar  newlinechar I live in a poor community with a lot of petty crime, but violent crime is almost unheard of, and I KNOW that if there was ever a real problem, the police would respond and deal with me and the incident fairly.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that's the important difference. My community has faith in the police, and even though there are very few officers patrolling the streets, we know that they will actually respond when we need them to. newlinechar  newlinechar I honestly can't imagine what it would be like to live somewhere where there was gun crime, and people genuinely felt that the police would only make matters worse. newlinechar  newlinechar I hear a lot of comments on Reddit to the effect that 'Don't call the cops, they'll just kill your dog and make problems worse' but this is so divorced from my experience that it sounds insane to me. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that the problems in a lot of American cities are systemic and obviously cultural and racial. It's not fair to expect a police force to be able to sort this out. There needs to be bridge-building between cultures and communities. newlinechar  newlinechar I want to see some wealthy property and business owners walk into the poor communities that exist adjacent to their suburbs and honestly try to engage in dialogue with people. newlinechar  newlinechar We don't need a million man march, we need ten thousand hundred man marches.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW.

Randall Cobb too 
In AZ you can get a DUI for a variety of things that don't include driving. When I got mine, I was at a bar one night and had too much to drink. I called a cab to pick me up. When it got there, I had him stop by my car so I could grab my laptop bag that I didn't want to leave out overnight. There was a cop in the parking lot already, but I didn't think anything of it. He came racing over and busted me for DUI because I was 'in control of a vehicle' even though I was only grabbing a backpack out and it was blocked in the parking spot by my cab.  newlinechar  newlinechar I ended up having to take several weeks of alcohol abuse classes among other things, because anyone who has more than one drink at a time has a problem apparently. During the classes we covered different cases of people getting DUIs and what could get you in trouble. Obviously don't drink and drive. But don't be in your front yard with your car keys on you if you've had a drink. If you're within a certain distance of the vehicle you're still in control of the vehicle. Don't drink a beer on a hot day while mowing your lawn, a mower is a vehicle. One guy got a DUI while trying to fix his car in his driveway. The engine didn't start, but he was drinking a beer while working on it. One old woman got a DUI after church because someone hit her and the communion wine registered on the breathalyzer as a .01 and she had a grandkid with her. That one was a felony because of the kid. Another person got a DUI after leaving a hospital and driving too slowly. She told the cop she was tired after working a double shift then visiting her sick mother. You can get a DUI if the cop thinks you're too tired, and she got her 2nd DUI that way even though she had nothing in her system. newlinechar  newlinechar Drinking and driving is flat out stupid. But a lot of the laws now are just insane and geared towards making the states money.

I don't interpret it the same way you do.   newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to think that men have this idea that femininity is bad, but I see it more as femininity implies lack of masculinity, which is bad (for men). Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase 'you throw like a girl' is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to 'you don't throw like a boy.'   newlinechar    newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.   newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's all very silly, but things like this always are. I try to avoid those mindsets but none of us are immune from it. We're all just trying to find our way in a world filled with people telling us how to do it.

Oh man, high school. I was once sent to see the principal because a teacher saw me put my hand to my mouth and assumed I was ingesting some imaginary drug-- I had wiped my lips with a bit of napkin.

I know that can be difficult, but well-fitting clothes really do make any build look better. newlinechar  newlinechar * Stand up for yourself. Teachers may be authority figures, but as you implied there are definite limits on their authority, and more importantly there are limits to what is appropriate workplace behavior. 'This is my natural build. If you don't stop harassing me, I'll have to inform the principal.' (Say that politely!) newlinechar  newlinechar * This may be cliche at this point, but it really does get better. Almost everyone in high school is an asshole to some degree or another and eventually most of them grow out of it. In the meantime, try not to be one of those people as well, even if it often seems justified.

That's a bit extreme. I fully believe those parents had empathy for their child.

When you see someone destroying themselves, which is what her parents saw, empathy will make you stop them at almost any means.

Exactly this newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe Ricciardo, Vergne and Vettel are the three best drivers in the sport, but considering Newey's track record, we can reliably assume who really won those 4 world champions, since those drivers haven't been team mates with anyone not in the red bull academy. At the same time with Raikonnen, he's been up against a few proven teammates, including Massa, and he did about as well as expected (maybe a little worse, but hey it was his first year in the car again) against Alonso as you would guess when you look at how he compared to Massa, so there wasn't much of a surprise there. newlinechar  newlinechar For that reason I think Vettel is still the more controversial driver, because he hasn't faced a number of known top class teammates, and neither have any of his teammates, so you can't really say how good he is since you don't even know how good his teammates and the former teammates of his teammates are. newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, that'll all change next year, and if Vettel does anything less than stomp Kimi, the Alonso circlejerk will be full blast :)

What I find interesting about Buddhism is it's versatility. You can find Western Buddhists that don't believe in anything supernatural like reincarnation and see it as mind states - you do lots of good and you feel good (divine), and you can feel ghostly after a terrible deed that leaves you full of guilt.

Most cities follow a pattern due to segregation, its actually incredibly common for the south and west sides of cities to be the most dangerous because this is where minorities and african americans resided.

The game wasn't willing to let you roam far enough in the levels to create a world. If you found two paths, they both lead to the same area, it's just that one involved more enemies but more loot. It felt like every room had a purpose for gameplay reasons, and anything that didn't serve the gameplay mechanics of the level was cut. To their credit, Eidos did a great job of putting a TON of world-building dialogue, memos, and posters in the world to try to make up for that, but there's still no real substitute for letting the player see portions of the world that exist for reasons other than gameplay. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm disappointed that the hidden cache chain of the City petered out too. That was the best thing they did in the open-world part of the game, completely un-gamey and relying solely on the player's map reading abilities, and they just let it die off.

Replacing both the screen and digitizer is usually really easy. In this instance, it appears the screen/digitizer combo is fairly hard to come by (couldn't find it easily on Amazon), which is why the heat gun/hair dryer is involved (the glass is glued to the digitizer, and both sit over the LCD screen). newlinechar  newlinechar So, replacing just the glass should be pretty easy, just a little touchier. You'll have to heat the glass such that it will separate from the digitizer, then glue the new glass onto the digitizer.

&gt; The whole point of naturalism is to understand the sorts of things that naturally occur, no miracles required. newlinechar  newlinechar Naturalism accepts that the universe can come from nothing and information can spontaneously generate. These are not observable, are based on faith, and are miraculous by definition. Since what is natural is defined by the universe, the universe itself requires something supernatural for its birth. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The complexity of life arises from a much larger number of simple properties and repetitions. newlinechar  newlinechar So simple we don't understand them. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Perhaps the universe is larger, more chaotic, and more complex than we imagined, but the only thing convoluted here is the approach religious people take when trying to understanding it. newlinechar  newlinechar Right... the convoluted idea that instead of inflating the probabilities for a miracle to occur via an ad-hoc speculation every time we're proven wrong, perhaps this evidence of an intelligent design is suggestive of a designer? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If a deity were 'simple' it wouldn't be much of a deity. I can also use the simple answer 'magic' or 'because' with a toddler, but sometimes a one word answer is no answer at all. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that He's able to do things far beyond our grasp that we couldn't begin to understand that seems magical to us does not make Him necessarily simple or any less real.

It could have been an imploding pile of lol-cats for all I know or care. I rely on observation, and stop where it stops, and what's currently observed only points to a big bang.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many including myself are aware that our observations can be explained most eloquently and logically by a designer. To rule out this possibility is to exercise faith. If we have a designer, which is absolutely a distinct possibility by your own admission, then we are His creation therefor accountable to Him. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You're the one continuing to be dishonest, by having faith in and pretending to have knowledge of huge numbers of things beyond reality and the observable natural world. newlinechar  newlinechar I conclude that the evidence supports God, and I also maintain the Bible as a testimony to His nature and actions. These are testable hypotheses and remain valid with evidence to this day. Choosing not to explore this possibility is the free will of each individual at their own peril.

I'm not sure, honestly. newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to stuff like Bigfoot, I think it's not plausible they exist as noone anywhere has ever found any skeletal remnants, any remains of any sort (body, tools, cave paintings, etc.). If they've been living and breeding for decades or centuries, there would be remains of some sort. Plus, there'd have to be enough of them alive to sustain continued generations and it would be quite difficult to hide a population of Bigfoots (Bigfeet?). newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to ghosts/spirits, I didn't believe in any of that until I experienced it myself. I didn't want to believe in spirits and as a kid I rolled my eyes at ghost stories, but when I eliminated all other possibilities (that I could find/think of), and researched enough from all over the world, I concluded that we are beings of both corporeal and non-corporeal energy. I believe that sometimes our non-corporeal energy doesn't die with our corporeal energy. (BTW, I am Atheist.) newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to vampires and werewolves, well, I want to say they are fantasy and I do think they are, but I also acknowledge their bases in history (Photodermatitis, Anemia, Hypertrichosis, etc.) and part of me wants to believe in them.

So it seems we're clamoring that the shotgun isn't useful and needs to be buffed. But everyone's treating the symptoms of problem and not the core problem itself.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Heavy's burst damage is limited because of the ramp-up penalty.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Heavy's mobility is severely limited which causes him to get caught out of position a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar * His lack of mobility also causes him to eat more damage as he's limited in strafing or dodging the oncoming fire. This is especially the case when firing/spinning the minigun. newlinechar  newlinechar The natural/historical response to this is to use the sanvich to heal when the heavy has a chance. As long as his team is holding ground and he has cover, the heavy can replenish his health by remaining stationary for a specific period of time.  newlinechar  newlinechar People are trying to make the shotgun more useful, but this doesn't really address the core mechanics of heavy and tf2: newlinechar  newlinechar * Increasing his burst damage or making him a fat scout doesn't in any way increase his mobility - allowing him to still get caught of position. newlinechar  newlinechar * Multiple classes with greater mobility being able to dump well over 300 damage within a few short seconds still leaves heavy at a disadvantage. newlinechar  newlinechar * The problem with the shottie is that you can really only engage 1 person at a time. Compare this to stickies or rockets. A soldier/demo can place a rocket/sticky between two people and significantly damage both of them. Shotguns do not split damage like that. newlinechar  newlinechar * Although the heavy's shotgun increases his burst damage, pushing a corner with a shotgun is an unsound move as there is no telling what's on the opposite side. Previously you could jump/rev and be ready. Now you have to spinup and prefire the corner: giving the opponents time to retreat and allowing you to burn through ammo shooting at a wall/floor. newlinechar  newlinechar Heavy needs a mobility/HP buff to make the shotgun viable. Holding his own against demos/scouts/soldiers/pyros with the shottie is suspect. Even if he kills one opponent, the damage he took in the encounter will likely prevent him from being able to survive the next foe he encounters without a healthboost. newlinechar  newlinechar Prior to the unnecessary, clumsy nerf. Heavy's ability to time ambushes made him able to take out more than one opponent while operating at reduced health. Soldier has the ability to ambush people from high perches he has jumped to. Demo has sticky bombs for traps. Pyro has the backburner and axtinguisher for ambushes. Heavy has a spin up penalty.  newlinechar  newlinechar Simply adding a shotgun or weapon switch times only temporary increases his mobility. But he's still going to soak up damage, and he'll still be at a significant disadvantage to all the other ambush/explosive classes. This is why the majority of players will still equip the sanvich and deal with the atrocious ramp up penalty on their minigun. It's the best option for this nerfed class. newlinechar  newlinechar

Andrew has this nasty habit of jerking his head like he just got shot when he drives and someone puts a body on him. Don't pretend you've never seen him do this. The reason people point to that one is because it was an egregious example that got widespread media attention on major sports sites and blogs. No one documents every single flop from every game. Every team is guilty of selling contact. Some examples are worse than others. It's something to laugh about and generate discussion on changes. It's not something that any team can use to throw stones.

Nope. I totally agree with you. I tried phrasing it exactly like that for the entire first 18 months of her life. The minute I say, 'It really helps if' or 'I've actually had some luck trying' ('luck', I say, as if it's just lucky that I happen to have stumbled upon knowing what works, in an effort to spare his pride) or 'I've found that if you', I get immediately blowback and accused of being bossy. I'm sick of being accused of being bossy. When he gets that flustered, he's sarcastic with the kid and he's sarcastic with me.

TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though. newlinechar  newlinechar Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

Yes, but there are additional effects. For example, heating from the Sun causes the atmosphere to change in size as well, whereas the purely gravitational effect from the Sun is smaller than that of the Moon. I'm not an expert on these things, but the one impact I thought of was radio communication because the [ionosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#The_ionospheric_layers) changes from the solar heating and you can bounce certain radio signals off the bottom of the ionosphere (since they don't propagate through). I'd be interested to hear other possibilities for impact.

I think it's your associations that matter, mostly. Linguistically, negatives are not very compelling, but visual stimulation that has a powerful negative or transformational association does. newlinechar  newlinechar I support your experiment and think it's great, especially if it works for you! I'll present a couple ideas for your consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 3 panel comic sigil, showing the thing, the process by which it is transformed, and the result (symbolically, or sigilized statements) for example 1. You smoking 2. The 'death' of your relationship to smoking. You can depict the spirit of tobacco as you see it, for example. The death of its influence on you. 3. The transformation of the habit to one you would prefer. Like instead of a smoke break, an 'outside breath break' where you take the time to center your breathing and awareness. Or whatever habit you prefer. newlinechar  newlinechar Using death in the sigil statement. 'My relationship to tobacco dies and is transformed' might be a way to get around the negative quandary. 'My awareness destroys my relationship to tobacco.' Don't be afraid to use powerful and evocative words, they may also provide more inspiration for the form of the sigil, as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The underpinning of these ideas is working with the Tarot as a language for sigil construction, because it has concepts of transformation and destruction already visually depicted but inherently lacks negatives, at least from a linguistic process. Haven't fleshed this out yet, I'm sure others have done it.  Just think in terms of processes by which something might change, vs simply saying no.

They've been doing this in Lakewood for a very long time.  newlinechar The population of that town has doubled to 90,000 as of the last census because of the number of Hassidic attending the yeshivas there.  newlinechar They have also been caught blockbusting in Brick, Toms River, and Jackson. Blockbusting is where you buy a house on a block, then rent it to shitbags. Once the property values of the surrounding homes have dropped as a result, people in collusion with the original homeowner buy the surrounding homes at a significantly lower price and do the same thing as the first homeowner until all of the homes in a neighborhood are owned by the colluding parties.

That's true, hadn't really thought about the attack exp, however a lot of obby maulers (including pures) end up with 16 attack, either from that quest or from death plateau for climbing boots. Also, I've heard that 16 attack doubles the strength exp/hour at rock crabs compared to 1 attack which you may want to take into account, as training obby maulers can often be very slow.

My little brother has paranoid schizophrenia and when he is on his meds he is the nicest person you will ever meet, but if gets off them it gets real bad.

If it werent for that I wouldnt have what I have now. However, last year he was off his meds and ended up going to jail for a year. It was because he was curious what our youngest brother looked like from the inside so he chased him down the road with a knife. Luckily there was a cop driving by or Im not sure what wouldve happened. I would hate to see him on meth or crack. Schizophrenia is some scary shit.

Well, I have a PhD in law. It might sounds awesome, especially in the US, but here where I am it actually isn't. It doesn't mean anything. I work at the univeristy and sure, there is a lot of opportunity. But nothing is guaranteed. Mighjt happen, might not. Getting that position was already a struggle and I know many people would kill for it. Still, it's paid really low. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways. My mom has always been hot blooded. She tells hurtful things and then regrets it, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. I came to my parents for Christmas. My dad is very sick so I needed to help my mom with everything. And I did. I think she was glad I came only because of that. I was my Name Day on Christmas Eve and my birthday on 26th. She didn't give a shit. I didn't get anything from her, not even wishes. She is only nice for me when she needs some help, but she doesn't give anything back. It's the worst when someone is comming over and she wants to show off. The holiday season was full of visits and it got really frustrating to prepare everything, yet not even hear a simple 'thank you'. On Sun we had guests over - a couple with a kid, so she locked my dog in a room. Sure, the dog isn't accustomed to it, but we didn't know how our guests feel about dogs. But they were OK, actually they wanted my dog to be out, but my mom says no, because the dog annoys her. The guests kept peeking into that room, so the dog was barking constantly and my mom yelled at me. I had to take my dog for a long walk despite the darkness and frost. I wanted to go back to my place right then but I had drunk some alcohol so I couldn't. I told her how I felt about it, but she didn't react at all. newlinechar  newlinechar Today she was all nice as she invited four people over and she needed help with preparation. I did a lot, went shopping with her and spent half of the day in the kitchen. She cleaned the living room and locked it as she didn't want the dog to come into it as she would shed some hair... When fist guest arrives the dog was excited (she knows them and they're OK with dogs), so my mom locked her in another room. She started to whine as she was afraid of the fireworks and wanted to be with us. But my mom said no. I said that in such a case I'm going to spend the whole New Year's Eve in the separate room and my mom said she's fine with it, which was really hurtful, as I helped her so much and yet she cared only about the guests. I told her that. Then she said that it's her place and if I don't like it, I can go fuck out of there. So I started to pack myself. She didn't stop me only said that she's fine with it and added that I might as well not comming again any time. She was furious, probably because the guests saw it all. Then she started to cry, but I just left. When my uncle and aunt arrived (I was already on my way), they called me and asked me to come back, but I didn't want to. After I arrived at my place my mom called me and asked if I arrived safetly, then she gave the phone to my aunt who said that my mom is as she is and I should pay no attention to it and just come back. I didn't. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't feel good about it. But it was just enough. I felt like I'm some sort of servant the entire time. I feel unloved and unworthy, not even my mom shows any affection towards me. It all might seem really silly, but actually it runs really deep.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't choose anything.

A small group of owners owns them and utilizes them, and they get wealthy while nothing else happens economically.

'The right to place demands on others' is what a positive right is, and it's only used for things where people need defending from having their rights violated. This is why childcare applies in this situation. *Somebody* has to take responsibility for this child, and that means you either give the child up for adoption or make the parents do it. And child support doesn't only apply to men. Women have to sacrifice their lives and finance by law if they choose to keep the child as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's not forget that the man in our situation could have avoided it early on. He has full rights to prevent a pregnancy before it happens. Of course he has fewer rights once it's occurring within someone else's body. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that the woman's rights, that it would be barbaric to take from her, protect her decisions during this period isn't ideal, but it's a biological fact and you can't get around that without repercussions that are worse than the status quo. 
I tried to explain it further down, but it's not something I completely understand myself. I mean, socialisation comes into it - people tell us that we have to be manly and mock us if we're not. Men end up looking for ways to define and assert this manliness. Just look at how many movies there are about becoming a man (Mulan doesn't count).   newlinechar  newlinechar However, since manliness is mostly a social construct and the gender divide is reducing rapidly, it's hard to see what it is to be a man. As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.   newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, with age most of them develop a more internal idea of manhood and don't feel such a massive and constant need to prove their masculinity.

It's not as simple as that and you know it. A person can choose to do a great many things. A woman could choose to wait until she has the baby and then smother it and throw it out in the trash. Some cultures and beliefs systems include that as a valid choice. However to a woman who believes that abortion is murder, the abortion as a 'choice' it's no different than waiting until the baby is born and killing the infant at that time. It's not a valid choice for her. She could do it and then live the rest of her life believing she had murdered her own infant. Many would rather die themselves than do that.

Well, the oil will eventually run out.  
I do.  I want to have a beer with him.  See where it goes. newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously, he speaks English, you could talk to Krauss without feeling like an idiot.  I admire Sam Harris but I wouldn't want to have a beer with him.  Hitch, RIP, maybe, but it would seem dangerous.
I definitely agree, you laid out all of the shitty things about clubbing in general. If you got a stable and you're making serious money clubbing once a week with your bitches is a must. Bitches need to blow off steam, they love getting dressed up and when you got a big booth in VIP with 4-5 of your bitches and a couple close friends it's a lot easier to pull in high end talent. newlinechar  newlinechar With that being said if you're just starting out and only have one bitch and on a tighter budget, then trying to beat out every other swinging dick in the place puts you at losing odds in the first place. I'd never really try and spit game at a club in any situation though. All I'd do at clubs is follow these simple guidelines... newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Post up and look for eye contact. newlinechar 2. Approach when the time is right. Approach the bitches that are looking at you, not the ones you're trying to force eye contact out of them. If you don't get any looks back on a regular basis it's you, not them. Hit the gym. Buy better clothes. Smile more.  newlinechar 3. Keep game very simple, be polite, introduce yourself. Lots of compliments. Ask them questions. Be sincerely interested. newlinechar 4. When the right song comes on, ask them to dance. Don't treat them like your sister but don't escalate things just yet.  newlinechar 5. Once you've danced for one or two songs unless she is giving you VERY strong signals, end it right now. Tell them you feel a really strong connection with them and you'd like to see them again. Get the number and then give them a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Text her right in front of her to give her your number back.  newlinechar 6. Your work here is done. Leave the club. Again, if she was acting like she wanted more, keep the text conversation going. If you go to another club let her know you left because you had to meet up with some friends. If she keeps texting you, you can head back to the same club where she was at and say you ditched your friends to meet back up with her. If she's not texting you back then don't text her again till the next day. newlinechar  newlinechar At the end of the day that's how it's suppose to work, but a prospect like this will only turn into a money maker I'd say about 1 in 10. You also have your off nights where you don't get any eye contact or when you do, your approach doesn't work. Or when your approach works, you tell them you feel a strong connection and then get a cock blocking best friend come up and steal her away. etc. The point being I don't mean to give anyone the impression that the above is a fool proof system for pulling in bitches every night. It's just what I would do and it worked enough of the time to keep on doing it. newlinechar  newlinechar 
What goes in which pocket.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a guy, but I carry slightly more than what always fits in pants pockets but not nearly enough to justify bringing a bag everywhere. newlinechar  newlinechar Keys go in my right jacket pocket because, of course, I start the ignition with the right hand.   newlinechar  newlinechar Personal phone, cigarettes, and lighter in the left jacket pocket.  newlinechar  newlinechar Work phone in front-left pants pocket so I don't misplace it when I take my jacket off at the office, gum in the front-right just in case. newlinechar  newlinechar As is standard, wallet in back-right pocket.

Sounds/looks like a possible gas valve or pressure switch issue. newlinechar  newlinechar If it only runs for about 2 mins AND the blower(big motor in the bottom compartment) kicks on at some stage during this then it's unlikely the high limit temp will be reached in this period even with a weak switch. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard to tell but there's a definite and immediate clicking when the flames go out. To me that could be a weak coil in the valve. Although with stuttering flames it could be a pressure issue somewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar Check the rubber hose going to the round metal disc thing in the top left. Make sure it's clear. Does it click at all during the issue? On startup, the small inducer motor (at the top) will run and cause the pressure switch to 'click' once but that's all you should hear. newlinechar  newlinechar Also there may be an error code, if you look at the bottom panel is there a little porthole to look inside? Can you see any LED's? Are they flashing when it locks out?

On days when I wash my scalp I get more tangles than usual. I'm not sure what your hair type is, but after I wash and rinse the conditioner out, I'll add another round of conditioner that I use to detangle, then leave in for a while to absorb into my hair. When I detangle I lean my head to one side so my hair hangs free and start gently detangling from the ends of my hair and work my way up. I gently coax apart the knots and glide my fingers between the strands a little at a time. Then I rinse all the hair out of my hands (yuck, right?) and lean my head to the other side and gently detangle again from the ends and working up. newlinechar  newlinechar I wasn't sure from your OP if you detangle from the ends up or from the roots down, but if you've been working your way down try starting from the ends instead.

My problem is with the notion that fel reaver removes the bottom cards with your deck. It doesn't. If your win condition is at the bottom of your deck, you were gonna lose, REGARDLESS of whether fel reaver is there which is why I don't take that situation into account. newlinechar  newlinechar If your win condition is in your opening hand or before you play fel reaver you probably don't have the good opening any aggro deck NEEDS since your win condition is clogging up your hand. newlinechar  newlinechar If your win condition is right after you play turn 5-7 (since you would rather play sea giant in the late game) then your win condition is gone. newlinechar  newlinechar Tl dr: risking discarding your win condition isn't worth playing fel reaver as you are now hoping that it doesn't lie at the end of your deck OR right after fel reaver but rather in a small gap in between (a gap which is determined by your opponent

In general I agree with the whole 'encourage the trades' thing, but it shouldn't be the only conclusion people draw. My office just hired 3 entry level positions, but they were certainly hoping for a mid-level hire in at least one case. If it's hard to find mid-level positions now, just imagine how it'll be if parents all tell their kids that things like the social sciences are worthless. Unfortunately, this will hurt the more cut off, 'brain drain' areas the most.

Ya, now that the interview is done, I absolutely don't agree with any praise of NVC.  I agree with asking the easy open-ended questions and letting the person just get it out.

The 'toughest' question even came with such a bullshit lead-in. newlinechar  newlinechar I get that there may have been preconditions for the interview, including no hard questions.  If that's the case, she could deny the interview instead of acting like she is reading questions pre-written by Jay's attorney or Urick.  If that's not the case, maybe be a journalist and do some thinking to figure out what questions should be asked.  You came up with a great list and aren't even getting paid for it.

That's not a real reason, though. It's either saying that we exist in a strange universe where we have no answers for our fate or our existence vs 'a mystical thingy that we have no real understanding about did it'. You can either choose to believe that there is some invisible thing making the choices for your life, if you need that to sleep, or you can accept that it's a fucking mystery. Which is the real truth. Because if there is a god or isn't, we have absolutely no evidence of either, therefore it's all a mystery, and the way you choose the mystery is your choice.

Well... interestingly, if you have potatoes, then you have sugar. newlinechar  newlinechar A bag of potatoes is essentially just a bag of sugar!  newlinechar  newlinechar That is because potatoes are mostly starch.  newlinechar  newlinechar Starch is a sugar.  newlinechar  newlinechar (Starch is long chain molecular sugar).  newlinechar  newlinechar We don't think of starch as a 'sugar' because it doesn't taste sweet... but this just means that not all sugar is sweet tasting. Some sugars, such as starch, are bland tasting.  newlinechar  newlinechar So the next time your wife/girlfriend sends you out for a bag of sugar, and you come back with a bag of potatoes, then you can, scientifically, argue that you got her precisely what she asked you to get, and that she should have been more specific as to the molecular-length of the particular sugar molecules she was seeking...  newlinechar  newlinechar On second thought, if you want to... you know... later that night... then just get her the sweet tasting sugar!

What I want to suggest is that we have to consider a person's capacity in order to properly consider their actions praiseworthy or blameworthy.  It would be hard to judge exactly what would count as 'using all of one's capacity to help others'--as you said, one might think that we would have to limit ourselves to fulfillment of our most basic needs in order to be worthy of praise for any charitable actions, which intuitively seems wrong.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think that it is important to recognize the difference in my capacity and  your capacity for assisting the impoverished (etc) compared to the capacity of someone like Gill Bates.  You correctly point out that there is almost certainly more that you and I could be doing.  But there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you and I do not have anywhere near the capacity to make a significant dent in, for example, world hunger.  And if we wanted to try anyway, we would likely have to limit ourselves to bare necessities.  People like Gill Bates, however, have that capacity, and they can do it while continuing to live a more comfortable life than nearly anyone else on the planet.  So I think that the issue has a lot to do with the excess wealth specifically.  But I would be willing to accept that people like you and I are blameworthy to some extent for not doing more--e.g., for not donating more to charity.  However, it would be to a lesser extent than someone like Gill Bates, since Gill Bates's capacity greatly surpasses ours.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: replied before seeing your edit  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit 2 (after having read your edit, and the NYT article): newlinechar  newlinechar I'm inclined to think that the article is right for the most part.  People ought to do more than they are doing.  At the end, they suggested that a person making $50000 has the same obligation as a person making $100000.  They didn't say anything about people making $1-million or $100-million, but presumably they would say that they all should be as close to $30000 as possible.  It seems like it would fit well with that thought, though, that people making $100-million deserve more blame for not limiting themselves to $30000 than people making $50000 do, just in virtue of how much they are missing the target by.  If Person_A makes $1-million each year, and Person_B makes $50000, even if Person_A donates $500000 each year, and Person_B donates $0, Person_A is still missing the target by significantly more than Person_B. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a question for you, though.  Why should charitable contributions not be something we consider when evaluating whether or not a person if worthy of praise or of blame?  In what sense are charitable contributions different from that beach scenario?

Thanks. Sometimes I really let myself down by having a tantrum, and I'm always embarrassed by it. I still have them sometimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example at work the other day something wasn't going right for a client and he had to get on a flight in half an hour. I knew how to fix the problem with his laptop, that he needed for this trip, but I also knew there was a chance it could royally screw everything up. So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving.

Its just that my dad just drowned a few months ago and I've been at the extremes mood-wise. newlinechar  newlinechar Another dude totally fucked up his order for new employees computers and when they didn't show up, I found that he had ordered only 1 and put in the comments 'I need three of these'. That doesn't work, you need to order 3 systems if you want three. I threw my hands up in the air and scoffed. I realized that was rather rude of me, and again apologized later in the day for my response.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3 years ago my little brother died unexpectedly and 2 weeks later I was with my spouse in the store and we got separated. As I wandered looking for him and his friends in wal-mart. I was getting more and more upset. I was getting so stressed for no good reason (just emotional) and punched a hole in a box of merchandise. Finally found him and started crying that I couldn't find him and I was angry.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know I have problems with my emotions coming out and constantly working on ways to deal with stress.

If he wanted to draft EJ I highly doubt he would bolt out of Buffalo two years into the kid's career, but that's just my opinion.

At the time raffles and contests were banned in the Twitch terms of service as it was designed to protect Twitch. Third parties really don't like competitions using their service as they could be dragged into it as being responsible etc they've since updated the ToS (there is a new Promotions section) you're suppose to have text in the chat or read out that 'Twitch does not sponsor or endorse broadcaster promotions and is not responsible for them'. When a company is going through prepping to be bought out (like all the music licencing crack down) which it was at the time you've gotta be careful especially with a big channel. Yes its boring but these things are there for a reason, its all fun and games until the hammer comes down.

&gt; However, since it has been more than 10 years, he no longer has the rights to that work. So a publisher (or publishers) can release those books again, a movie studio can make a movie from the books and a lot of people can cash in...except for him - the guy that actually wrote the book. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all, there is nothing stopping him from selling his old books just because the copyright has expired. People sell copies of works that are in the public domain every day.  I assume you're familiar with Project Gutenberg. I can freely download all those books, yet many of them are on my shelves today and I paid for them.  Let's say you're a huge fan of this fictional author and you want a copy of one of his old books. You are a fan and want to support him, so why don't you buy it from him directly? He can sell it off his website for next to nothing. He can sign them. He can update them and sell them under a new copyright. He isn't left out of the fun. He can even make movies based on his books (his involvement in a production is going to make it much more appealing to fans). At the same time, others can also sell his books or just throw them up on the internet and let other people read them. In the end, our fictional author gets new fans, more recognition, and more money (from sales of his books both old and new).    newlinechar  newlinechar How is this a bad thing?  newlinechar  newlinechar As for Mr. Martin, he absolutely should lose rights for those first books and if someone comes along and creates (for example) an animated series based on those first books more power to them, and all the better for fans of animation many of which will now run out and start reading the books (including the new ones still under copyright) gaining George even more fans who will gladly fork over their cash for his new works going forward.

This is a weird meme that has gotten traction in some political circles. No, there was some token assistance from the Chinese, but the Chinese were not huge fans of the Vietnamese. They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive). The soviets were not on much better terms, and between their lack of interest on the one hand and their inability to project geopolitical power outside their near-abroad on the other, they didn't do much. There were some advisors and such on the ground, and that was it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not arguing for leftist agitation. I'm arguing that you should see things as they actually happened.

Listen, I am not an NYCFC fan and will not pretend their existence doesn't piss me off because of the Chivas bullshit that foreshadowed this happening, but I do not blame NYCFC fans for it. That said, Third Rail needs to go fucking mental. NYCFC is Garber's baby, and if it fails, it is a direct Garber screw up, and if the Third Rail turns into an issue, the league will take notice. newlinechar  newlinechar You all need to protest, scream, yell, and do everything possible to cause a commotion. Every support group does, but the Third Rail needs to be the leader on this. There is going to be a lockout, and it is going to be ugly, but once it is over, the fans in this league need to send a goddamn message that **this bullshit cannot, will not, and will never be acceptable**. newlinechar  newlinechar This needs to be Garber's Watergate, Lewinsky, and Teapot Dome all in one. He needs to be gone. He is hurting the league, and we need to send the message to our owners that Garber cannot continue as commissioner.  This needs to be a coordinated effort, and I believe the Third Rail needs to be the leader of it.

&gt;But, looking past the naming convention, we already have the bulldog repeater and the name bulldog doesn't represent a long range fighter very well, which is the primary attribute of the deep space fighter. newlinechar  newlinechar So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO). newlinechar  newlinechar Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well. newlinechar  newlinechar There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)). newlinechar  newlinechar IDK, overall I like the name.

Sure, you can. But they generally go a lot better if you're partaking as well. It probably doesn't make sense from a pure cash outflow analysis now, but for me it goes into greater relationship building that ends up directly affecting my salary. There's something to be said for the social effect alcohol has on building relationships. I have to deal with my boss in a very professional manner 95% of the time I'm around him, but he's good about cutting back and building our relationship personally when he takes us out to bars. This ends up affecting how we interact when we're back at the office. If he generally likes me as a person outside of work, it makes dealing with the things that come up inside work a lot easier, and usually translates into him being more willing to invest time into teaching me which helps me perform better and meet his expectations more easily. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, for client expenses it's always covered. At training events with my peers it's more hit or miss. At this stage in my career, it's an expense I don't mind having. As I get into my 30s this will definitely shift, but I have a ton more people to meet/work with. Free booze is the modern day mana from above. I won't argue with that!

Absolutely. I'm bummed because, otherwise, I thought she was wonderful. I'd never met anyone quite like her and was hoping we would at very least be friends. I felt there was definitely a romantic spark between us--but I couldn't get past the nagging part of me that suggested the old axiom 'if she wanted to spend time with you, she would make time for you.' I guess I kind of always knew this might happen, but I'm upset at her choice of method. To maintain contact for 4 months and then just vanish one day without warning is pretty lame.

A lot of things. It started when I was young - so young that I couldn't make the right choices for how I ate and so by the time I was 10 I was obese.

I'll start us off I suppose, a fairly long time ago me and my boyfriend went to a swinger party where I had met a really nice girl. I've never really been into girl on girl sex, I find penis-less sex less than appealing, though I've only ever tried it myself once. Skip forward to when me and this girl, who I shall call 'Megan' in bed, I'd taken off her pants, and after rubbing the middle of her panties, found a rather peculiar shape from the inside. After pulling them down, *PLOP!* out came a penis. newlinechar  newlinechar I freaked out and ran to my boyfriend (Who was waiting in the living room), as if it was some kind of roach as I was a helpless school girl. A minute later or so Megan came out crying, deeply hurt by how I reacted.

Right, the same way you would when you play it normally on your PS4.
I just can't wrap my head around that happening though. In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR Ward won't be a 'Super Villain', he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him

That makes sense. At the same time, if you're already doing all the work of online advertising, deviantart, facebook etc, wouldn't it be a bonus for people to be able to come in and look at your artwork? There are plenty of home businesses that do well while having a home location (I'm thinking cleaning or metalwork or mechanics etc). I don't see it so much as an end-all be-all without any sort of advertising.

&gt;I'm going to speculate wildly and say that under 20% of RDR posters have read 20 pieces of literary fiction in their lives, and under 1% of r/writing posters even know what literary fiction is. But everyone reads genre fiction, so it's much easier to get worthwhile feedback, even if it's just a personal opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's interesting that you brought this up, because I noticed that there's a substantial amount of animosity towards literary fiction / MFA writers here (even more-so in /r/writing), and that people conflate MFA work with 'cookie-cutter narratives' and 'purple prose', when in fact –and just look at recent graduates from the Iowa Writer's Workshop– many of the best (and most original) writers today have gone through the MFA system.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's upsetting to see the general ignorance in this sub (and of course, the internet as a whole —this is already a very well-maintained garden), especially when novice-level attempts at literary fiction are met with half-serious 'oh you must be in an MFA program' comments. And then! To think that these same commenters have only published KDP Singles, if at all —and have yet to attract an agent, or complete a book / movie deal with a publishing house, or have their work looked at by a professional editor, or win a single grant, honor, or award for their writing (NONE of which requires that you 1) possess an MFA, and/or 2) write literary fiction). It's enough to give the literary fiction writers on this sub a persecution complex.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is primarily why I was speculating about the possibility of a smaller, more focused sub. There has to be at least ~20 of us out of the 4000 here right? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

We altered racist and sexist books and media by censoring the content. For example the N word was removed from huckleberry Finn. This is an was change because it simply requires deleting a single word. Where as inclusivity for lifestyles that do not align with those presented in the hypothetical novel would arguably alter the content the author was intending to portray. This could be seen as changing the underlying meaning of the novel which I see as as big of an issue as a heteronormative society. I am adamantly against censure for any reason especially when reframing the context of a novel so that a child or student understands it isnt representative of modern society is a cleaner solution. newlinechar

Generally what people say when they talk about progressivism in politics. Greater acceptance, more working together as a society, etc. Any thoughts that people consider new and morally correct. I'm not arguing against that, I'm just saying people will use it as justification to get angry at people who don't have the same political opinions as them.  newlinechar  newlinechar The more I think of this the more I realize I don't really believe in any absolute politics. Everything is situational and at a personal level. I disagree with a vast majority of people, but I'm not certain I'd say I hate them, just I dislike hatred and conflict and feel the only way to move past that is at a personal level. If people can do that, well that's good for them. Change past anywhere at our current level of incredibly basic tribal politics on any significant scale is, well kinda silly and unrealistic. Before I saw fascism as a way to harness this and make everyone relatively happy and alive, but now, ehhh. I'm becoming less of a dreamer and more thinking about moving into the woods with an echo box of like minded people to an extent where conflict would be resolved by agreement to the right of self, but even then I don't feel much morally better. Maybe the only way to be 'right' is to live as a hermit and be free of any poison that comes as a byproduct to human interaction. But that also seems radical and silly. Or maybe no one is right, and anything will work if people get defensive and tribal enough. And I think I just went full circle to why I'm a fascist.

In book 2, we find out that Unalaq hired some bandits to raid the Northern Tribe and who then fled to hid in the spirit forest up there (where the spirit portal is).  newlinechar  newlinechar Tonraq, in pursuit of the bandits, over zealously burned down the forest in order to catch the bandits, and thus was 'banished' to the Southern Tribe. newlinechar  newlinechar He was either living there for decades before being appointed by the Southern Tribe, or he was probably appointed head chief of the Southern Tribe by the Northern Chief (his father), since he was next in line to get the head chief of the Northern Tribe, as the result of the banish (too keep the 'royal bloodline' in power or to keep the snafu from making press). newlinechar  newlinechar After the opening of the portals, it is very possible that Tonraq was elected by the Southern Tribe to be the head representative or he just kept his position.

&gt; the standard library is outsourced to a third party company newlinechar  newlinechar I've poured the last 8 years of my life into VC's STL, do I count? newlinechar  newlinechar As I mentioned at CppCon 2014, licensing Dinkumware's STL in the mid-90s was an excellent decision. In addition to achieving C++98/03 conformance, this made it possible to pick up TR1 and C++11/14 years later. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The marketing never pointed out the HUGE disclaimer newlinechar  newlinechar On VCBlog, I [clearly said](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx): 'In VC11, we intend to completely support the C++11 Standard Library, modulo not-yet-implemented compiler features.  (Additionally, VC11 won't completely implement the C99 Standard Library, which has been incorporated by reference into the C++11 Standard Library.  Note that VC10 and VC11 already have &lt;stdint.h&gt;.)' newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree that 2012 had a bunch of bugs, for several reasons. The biggest reason was the huge influx of new code (TR1 in 2008 SP1, lots of C++0x in 2010, atomics/multithreading in 2012). Compensating for missing compiler features was another source (e.g. variadic templates). Working Paper churn was also quite problematic (e.g. this led to weirdness in &lt;random&gt;). In 2013, [we fixed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/06/28/c-11-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013.aspx) many of these bugs (and switched to real variadic templates), and 2015 will contain [even more](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/06/06/c-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-visual-studio-14-ctp1.aspx) fixes. (I'll be writing another VCBlog post explaining the fixes between 2015 CTP1 and RTM.) newlinechar  newlinechar Also, since people always ask: 2013 shipped almost all of the C99 Standard Library, and 2015 is completing the missing pieces, modulo extremely minor omissions (I could look them up, but I'm on vacation; IIRC it's a couple of the FP macro things, and tgmath.h which is irrelevant to C++).

I don't know what sort of universe you live in, but I know of nobody that has made that argument.

The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February. The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required. newlinechar  newlinechar The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter.  newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper).  newlinechar  newlinechar Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley.  newlinechar  newlinechar Long post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.

my biggest suggestion is to not use rockin green.  I wanted it to work so badly for us but it really doesnt work at all.  Rockin green products are pretty much just entirely made up of water softeners.  You need a surfactant which is found in most main stream detergents.  What happens is 'dirt' gets removed from what youre washing in the machine and goes into the water during agitation.  The surfactant binds to the 'dirt' sort of like it being trapped in a little bubble.  So when the water drains the 'dirt' goes with it.   newlinechar  newlinechar That being said my biggest suggestion would be to strip them, do a bleach soak, and start using a mainstream detergent such as Tide.

Islam is based on Christianity. From what I understand the Bible was corrupted so God came down again and told Muhammad verses through Angel Gabriel which were later written down into the Koran after his death.

Seeing as alcohol tends to be a lot of sugar, making sure he keeps an eye on his bloodsugars so they're not going too high. Since it's 'partying drinking' and not 'a beer with dinner drinking', it's going to be hard to even roughly guestimate what his sugar intake is going to be through the night. Unless someone has a good suggestion (which I would like to hear, too), he's going to have to take a reaction-based approach to insulin intake, possibly not taking a proper / final correction until the night is done. If the likelihood is that you're going to get pass-out-drunk, it's best to play it cautious with the insulin intake. Having the usual sugar tablets along is a smart move. You shouldn't have to babysit him, just be aware that on top of any hangover he's likely to be feeling the effects a high bloodsugar as well.

Totally agree. I'm on this sub every day and would be absolutely thrilled to become a mod. But the theory from our current one (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/2pdq06/i_thought_we_put_a_stop_to_dream_board_posts/cmvxrt8)), however is that the community is self-policing, meaning that problematic posts will be sorted out through downvotes as opposed to active moderation.

I'll second this. In some fields, a PhD is a great path to having many exciting and financially beneficial job opportunities. In other fields, it may actually hamper your job prospects because you'll have 4-6 years less industry experience than your peers, yet there aren't really many jobs in the field that would truly require a PhD. Then in some fields, a PhD qualifies you for only one thing: an academic job, in an era where 'academic job' has mostly come to mean 'adjunct with zero job security making less than minimum wage'. newlinechar  newlinechar So anyway, yeah. In some cases, getting a PhD is the best idea ever, but people should really do their research and be realistic about the prospects based on their field and their own situation.

I'm guessing manga books don't count? :P newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a big fan of the movie 5 Centimeters Per Second. It's available fully English subbed [here on Youtube and is only 1 hour long](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVbnt4vQE6w). It can appear to be a boring movie from the outside. There's no amazing people with superpowers or even villains. It's just focused on a story between a guy and a girl who become close friends, but life forces them to move away from each other. It takes place in a time where cellphones weren't commonly in use, so they had to communicate the old-fashioned way with hand-written letters. newlinechar  newlinechar It's depressingly realistic. The title refers to the speed of the cherry blossom petals falling from the tree. They're symbolic of people, because people start out close together like the petals on the cherry blossom, but they scatter and gradually drift apart. The ending is just an emotional gut punch, but I love it because again, it's extremely realistic and based on life. newlinechar  newlinechar It's kind of interesting though because now we have all these forms of social media and the Internet. I wonder if this movie would be less applicable to kids who are growing up now in the age of social media. newlinechar  newlinechar Also the animation is stunning, and I believe handdrawn? I think [this scene](http://thecajunsamurai.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5centimeterspersecond-5.jpg) from the movie is one of my favorites because the landscape is so beautiful. It's basically scenery porn. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy New Years!!! newlinechar

Adnan is serving a life sentence based on the testimony of a witness who admits he deliberately fabricated large swathes of his testimony in order to protect his own interests. newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't some minor little 'oh well' issue.

Honestly they don't do a very good job, though. From what I understand, they tend to ban in huge waves, which just isn't an effective way to keep the economy stable and free of ill-gotten goods. Right now gold farmers farm until all their accounts get banned all at the same time, then they acquire several new accounts all at the same time and keep their operation going.

Bugs I've noticed since the patch that really piss me off: newlinechar  newlinechar * Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere. newlinechar * Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall.

My pup has definitely lunged at people before. My roommate was making noise in our unlit kitchen in a large black hoodie, and Chief was whining at my bedroom door to go investigate. I knew it was my roommate who had just gotten home, so I didn't worry about letting him out. He lunged at her barking, but as soon as she said 'Hey Chief!' he turned his ferocious barking into his whiney greeting he does when anyone gets home.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another time we had some thuggish kids walking down our street. Chief was growling at them from the window, in typical GSD fashion, when the kids walked into our front yard and started barking back at him. I put Chief's leash on and opened the front door, mostly just to ask the kids to cut that shit out. Chief *lunged* at them snarling, and they ran off before I could say anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Would Chief had actually followed through with a bite/attack if something (like my roommates voice or his leash) hadn't stopped him?

I am finding so much bad and conflicting information about this case that it feels like my head is about to explode.  newlinechar  newlinechar The latest piece of conflicting information is a doozie. As I'm reading the article by David Lohr I'm thinking *this is great,up to date and he even interviewed a State Trooper that investigated the accident.*  newlinechar  newlinechar Then as I'm about half way through the article this catches my eye: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Hager had been visiting his girlfriend in Fairfax County, Virginia, and had left her home at about 7:45 a.m. on the day of the crash. Later that day, Hager stopped at his father's home in Gloucester County. His father wasn't there at the time, but Hager did call him at about 12 p.m. newlinechar  newlinechar 7:45 am??? 12:00 pm???? I thought this accident happened at 1:30 am!!!!! All the information I saw prior to this article says 1:30 AM!!! Go back to the beginning of the article and read this: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's what police found at the crash scene on the afternoon of Monday, June 26, 1995,  newlinechar  newlinechar AFTERNOON????? What???? Wait a minute!!!  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Did you hear that???? That was the sound of my head exploding! newlinechar  newlinechar I think this one can be solved if everyone that is attempting to solve it is working with the same valid facts.     newlinechar  newlinechar I just joined WebSluths in hope of finding some accurate information on this case.

SPOILERS, duh newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Note TPS takes place BETWEEN 1 and 2, meaning that TPS happened after the events of Knox.

Chiming in here.  I actually worked on Poxnora as a designer for about 3 years, bridging between Octopi and SOE ownership.  The last part of your post, about power creep, is the biggest thing that will translate into hearthstone if Blizzard doesn't consider it early.   newlinechar  newlinechar The business models for this kind of game demand the release of new cards, they simply don't make much money otherwise.  In order to make the new cards desirable it is very difficult to avoid bringing up the baseline of power over time.  One of the large factors contributing to the decline of Poxnora's balance and fun was the requirement to keep all cards in circulation at once.  This makes it increasingly hard to create new cards without resorting to complex new effects or large combinations of existing effects. newlinechar  newlinechar I think Blizzard should strongly consider breaking the game up into limited play sets as time goes on, assuming they continue with a business model built around driving users to acquire the latest cards.

&gt; It's not so much a catastrophic polarization as it is a slow legitimation of what used to be an absolutely unacceptable agenda. newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair, isn't this sort of a matter of perspective?  The kind of moderate-ish ethnic nationalism you see out of much of the new populist right in Europe would have been 'mainstream' conservative thought a generation ago.  It's also interesting to me that people like Marine Le Pen and Timo Soini seem to be having a lot of success outflanking the traditional center left parties on economic issues.  Many of those parties moved away from the economic left the past 25 years and compensated with more aggressive social liberalism to differentiate themselves from the opposition.   newlinechar  newlinechar I would argue that much of the new support for the populist and far right in Europe is the result of them filling a vacuum the old parties left behind, not some new right wing trailblazing.  Add that to a bad economy stoking anti-establishment feelings and people are less willing to stay loyal to the mainstream parties.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell.

My argument would be his poor track record most seasons and his unwillingness to adjust his scheme for the players he has to work with. His defense was always predicated on a bend don't break mentality so there weren't a lot of blitzes. In 2011, it worked because we had an amazing line that could get pressure while only rushing 4. This year he should have blitzed more in my opinion because we weren't getting a ton of pressure rushing 4 which gave Qb's time to pick apart our depleted secondary. So while it wasn't his fault that we had a lot of injuries it was his fault that we didn't adjust our scheme to try and cover up those injuries. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, that's a solid username, have you ran it past Carol in HR?

Looked it up - looks interesting.  I never played Cities XL because when I heard about it, I heard the online MMO thing (I don't even know that I knew it had a single-player mode).  So I see that Skylines will be single-player, which is good.  I don't have Steam, but I know Banished was available without it; will the same be true for Skylines.  If it is, do you know if it will require a persistent Internet connection?
Even when you got better loot in Destiny, it just wasn't...fun. The guns didn't feel different or interesting, or change at all through the game.

completely unrelated to this announcement, beyond his method of communicating it.  More and more, I find myself disliking him as a person.  I like his books, Love his charity, but he kind of comes across as an asshole who thinks his farts don't stink (if you understand the phrase).  His foreword in 'Slow Regard for Silent Things', came across as someone saying that 'if you don't like this book, you just don't get it and aren't one of the cool kids'.  I follow him on twitter and he constantly says things on there that just come across as super douchey. For instance, he doesn't post that he thinks the new Hobbit movies suck, but that 'I'm trying really hard not to judge you folks who went to see the Hobbit movies.....'.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'll buy doors of stone whenever it comes out and I'll continue to support Worldbuilders as its a fantastic charity, but I'm just not really going to be a fan of his anymore.  He just buys into his own celebrity a tad too much for my liking.

My mom got me one, finally, after months of begging, for Christmas. A Diva cup.  newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair, it wasn't that hard a sell on my awesome hippie mom, but my dad wasn't at all reasonable and that's where the money came from. I would have got it (A Mooncup, actually, seems preferable, and the replacement in roughly ten years will be a MCUK) myself if I had a credit card and didn't find it insulting I have to pay for my necessities at 17.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was actually excited for my period. I'm using it right now, and it's fucking wonderful. It took me literally four hours to get it in the first time (I hadn't read the part about holding the fold *as low on the cup as possible*, and it kept popping open too soon), but I'm on the second day now and you can't feel it at all when you get it in right (admittedly I'm gonna need practice, there is *very* slight pressure when you do it wrong), no leaking (I slept naked last night! No diaper panties! No Japanese sheets! It was a fucking miracle!), and having a mL amount for just how little blood menstruation really is is really cool. newlinechar  newlinechar And not the 'you can't even feel a tampon!' lies. You really can't. And you really can feel confident you won't ruin your panties. Until you get it down pat, even the leaking is minimal, one of the liners you have left over will last the whole day. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I've read everything I can on them, and they truly are safe if used with proper care- washing your hands, cleaning it, and leaving it in the cool carrying bag that nobody would be 'haha you're gonna put it in your *vagina* ha ha nasty' in public at a glance, unlike a pad or tampon.

My little sisters' best friend, who I can say is generally a nice girl, vehemently told me not to dump it in the sink because 'I use that too', like it's any of her goddamn business what I do, and like it would affect her anyway. I can say fuck them and laugh, but I'm sorry to say some people *can't*. newlinechar  newlinechar TL:DR; I am a menstrual cup user and I think everyone should be given the option.

I think it's really hard, because I didn't grow up with normal clothing.  So one example might be, growing up, empire waists were forbidden, because it was too close to the chest and it would draw men's eyes to look there.  Really most clothing that's not loose and untailored looks immodest to me. newlinechar  newlinechar And psychologically, I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty.  Like, I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest, even if she's more covered than many of her less well endowed sisters.  I feel like I get this from other women too - a lot of people assume I put a lot of work into my 'figure', maybe I'm wearing lots of padding or have implants, or that I'm on a diet and focused on my weight all the time.  And I feel like I don't look like a modest girl, because I'm very thin and have DD's, when most modest women I know don't look like that.

A lot of individuals (like me and you) don't agree. The MVP voters seem to have an understanding, though. Usually, there is a runaway winner for MVP that most voters agree on, and it's been a QB lately.  newlinechar  newlinechar Really, what we don't agree on is not what it IS, but what it SHOULD be.  newlinechar  newlinechar We both know a QB is going to win this year, and probably next year, and probably the year after. Because we both know that MVP voters vote on most valuable player, and not most exceptional player. So we both agree on what the award IS.  newlinechar  newlinechar We don't agree on what is SHOULD be. You think it should really award the most exceptional player, especially when that player is having a historic season. And, many of the other Watt supporters have the same viewpoint...that it should be used to identify the most exceptional player, even if it's not used for that purpose now.

Basically, every single thing needs an Intelligence to be observing it at all times in order to keep it in a definite form and to direct it/keep it from dissolving back into quantum foam. newlinechar  newlinechar After an Intelligence has been active for a while (I originally wrote 'around for a while' but this is inaccurate, all Intelligences are eternal, but some just kind of sit around doing nothing while others explore their surroundings,) it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy, thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of Godhood. But the more you have influence over, the harder it is to observe every single individual particle. newlinechar  newlinechar So as you ascend in degrees of Godhood, you recruit other Intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you. As you evolve into a more and more complex entity, you recruit more and more Intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a spiritual evolution, each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution. You organize a more complex spiritual (spirit = plasma/electricity or something very similar) form, then incarnate into a solid form that matches it. After accruing experience in that solid form, you return to a purely spiritual form and take what you've learned (learning is much easier in a material form) and evolve your spiritual body (with or without help, see below,) then re-incarnate, taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form. newlinechar  newlinechar In addition to reincarnation, there is resurrection. newlinechar  newlinechar Resurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter. The best of both worlds, without the limitations. Once you reach this point, you are ready to take the next step, which is to assist other Intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies. newlinechar  newlinechar Resurrected beings can reproduce, and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own. They can re-organize spirits from lower forms too, for example a dog to a chimp. It's possible, though much more difficult, for an Intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body (JHVH did this, hence why He is called self-created.) Once an Intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way, it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state. newlinechar  newlinechar After creating spirit bodies, a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit. This is what Adam and Eve did. They voluntarily gave up their resurrected state, after populating the Earth with spirits, in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they (we) could experience the next step. newlinechar  newlinechar As Adam and Eve fell, so too did the Earth, from its former place of glory at the center of the Galaxy to its present position at the tip of the Orion spiral arm. Adam and Eve left the congregation of the Elohim (Hebrew word meaning the Gods, plural, not God, singular) to rejoin mortality for our benefit. Later, JHVH did the same, but whereas Adam and Eve fell to bring death on themselves, JHVH incarnated as the man Yeshua Ben Yusuf of Nazareth to bring eternal life on Adam and Eve and all their progeny. newlinechar  newlinechar The Egyptian religion depicts the spirits of sinners (those whose hearts are heavier than the feather of Maat) being fed to Ammit, the crocodile/lion/hippo goddess of chaos. Basically those whose choices have taken them to a moral dead-end are dissolved back into quantum foam to be recycled; this happens after they are given EVERY chance to take a better path.

Those look a lot like my first attempts too! newlinechar  newlinechar So, through trial and error I learned: newlinechar  newlinechar * Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.    newlinechar * Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails.  newlinechar * Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help. newlinechar * Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible. newlinechar * Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment.  newlinechar  newlinechar These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Welding cast is always a pain. The sand used in the casting process always manages to get into the base metal. The metal also has large pores that trap all sorts of crud like oil, grease, coolant, dirt, and who knows what else.  newlinechar  newlinechar You die-grind the area about to be welded and do a hot bead with medium filler, which will look like crap and full of crud and porosity. You then grind all that crap off, and weld again. You keep doing that til you get a GOOD full metal weld in. Then move forward to the next section of build-up and do that again, and again, and again, and again. newlinechar  newlinechar So you actually weld the same area sometimes 4-5 times buttering the base metal til you get good fusion and good metal. Then as you buildup some of the crud floating on the top of your previous bead will cause problems on the next bead, so you float it up to brush/grind it off. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a pain. Lots of wire brushes, lots of die grinding, lots of acetone. It's mostly in the prep work , the welding itself doesn't take very long.

You claim he just sat there with his kids, but if you watch the video he doesn't even know it happened until after people are hit by it.

&gt; What people didn't know about Blockbuster is that I was given free reign to simply forgive any amount of late charges. All you have to do is be nice and have a good excuse. Your kid rented a playstation with your card and didn't return it for 3 weeks? No sweat. Just bring it back and the $300 or so late charges are forgiven. That easy. Wanna be a mean sonofabitch? Well screw you pal. We'll just take it off your card. newlinechar &gt; Blockbuster's stance was that you get more money out of a returning customer than you would being hardline about late fees. Of course, we didn't advertise that... newlinechar &gt; (This pertains to the franchise I worked for. I don't know what the corporate stance would be) newlinechar  newlinechar Are you joking?  newlinechar  newlinechar You sound like you're talking up a policy of one of the most tragic companies in American history. Blockbuster sank like the Titanic so let's not pretend that *any* of their policies were  successful. Particularly the policies of how they treated their customers. newlinechar  newlinechar You're not God as a Blockbuster manager. That's like being the captain on the titanic except about 1000 times less glamorous. If Blockbuster ever charged me for something (in a similar fashion how you claimed you could just write it off or forgive it), I'd simply call my credit card company and refuse the charge.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can guarantee you I wouldn't be paying your charge if I didn't want to, particularly if it's just an afterthought that you could dismiss randomly based on whether someone kissed your ass or not.  newlinechar  newlinechar Look, if the company was worth a shit, they'd still be around. They sucked. They clung to an outdated business model, they clung to outdated media and they refused to embrace technology until it was too late. On top of that EVERYONE HATED THEM.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know lots of people went to Blockbuster for a while but it was out of having no options rather than wanting to go. You do realize how a business like that is doomed to fail eventually, right?  newlinechar  newlinechar It was a miserable shitty company and policies like the one you just admitted to is part of the reason why people were celebrating when it went under. newlinechar  newlinechar Good riddance.
the editing was OK, the plays were fine, but anyone who watches the LCS has seen all of them. newlinechar  newlinechar However the video it self was VERY predictable based off of the music, framing, and filters you put on each scene. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah, sad music and greyscale.

&gt; I see, I think I would like it as long as they don't make Hans the main villain of the show or something, in all honestly if they did a spin off I would prefer if they mostly left Hans aside. He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job. newlinechar  newlinechar I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times. newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming. newlinechar  newlinechar I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.

That brings up an interesting question.

That means that in the US, there is one starting quarterback per  9,878,125 people. There are 7 billion people in the world, or 708 (rounding down) NFL starting caliber guys in the world. Subtract 32 (for those already on NFL rosters) and that's 676 who mathematically could start right now for a franchise. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to find just ONE of those guys before Sunday.

Yes: I am strongly disagreeing with that 'point'. I most strongly disagree that 'a phone meeting with... a dozen other members of the ... team' is not one of the most efficient ways to quickly track down a one-off bug involving time-zone/date shenanigans that may involve user environment wrinkles that may require the test machine to be quickly reset for another 'clean' pass at the problem.  You get to keep working and tracking down the issue while talking with the team: **this is a hyper-efficient approach to the problem**. newlinechar  newlinechar If someone comes into my office for an interview and says that this is not an efficient approach for a hot high-priority issue, I have grave concerns about that person.  Maybe you can provide an alternative better solution for 'each team member working directly on diagnosing and fixing their share of the problem while maintaining an instant line of multiway communication', but it's still excellent.  And someone having bad meetings at their company doesn't invalidate what was clearly and demonstrably a productive meeting here. newlinechar  newlinechar We can get into the meta of it sucking for MTGO to have high priority issues on a regular basis, but from a development and test perspective the response was bang-up and the criticism unfair and unfounded.

I really feel like this shouldn't all be put on the OP. The roommate should also be held accountable for leaving her puppy unattended. Obviously no one expects something like this to happen, but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). If the roommate wasn't watching the puppy, the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items, going potty inside, etc). Similarly, OP should have crated his own dog if he knew Charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault, but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated. Should he help out with bills? Probably, yeah. But should he feel obligated to foot 100% of the expenses? I really don't think so.

This I think is what a lot of ppl advocating for horizontal progression forget, ultimately a vast swath of the community is gonna decide on the small handful of efficent builds and anyone who isn't running one of those is gonna get vote kicked from any duty/party finder they join. Horizontal progression is great on paper and opens up a lot of choices but unless each fight is dramatically tuned to effectively give different weights to different abilities, a couple sets will just eclipse the rest. Hell even the small amount of fights that might manage to pull it off will probably just frustrate the larger playerbase 'great i need a specific gear set or else no one wants me to join their X farming party better leave all that garbage on my retainer' etc. 
I don't think it's always a bad plan. They sound like classes for students looking to major in math so that they develop familiarly with mathematical rigor. To my understanding they are to be taken instead of the courses designed for use by all departments and in place of calculus requirements.

On Defense, every single starter except for 1 went on to play in the NFL, most of them being high draft picks. newlinechar  newlinechar If we could time travel these 2 teams to the Rose Bowl to play against each other with, say 2 weeks to prepare for the game... I really think it's at least a 50/50 shot for Miami to wint, if not in their favor.

I'm not trying to piss you off and I apologize if you've taken my comments that way.

These two points are very common mis-perceptions in the trucking world. Again, sorry for pointing that out. 
Except this wasn't an 'illegal' stop. Cops can pull you over at their own discretion. They don't need evidence or to prove probable cause. A traffic stop is not an arrest. If the cop tried to detain you for an unreasonable amount of time, or if he'd searched without permissions or a warrant, then that would be illegal, but the stop itself wasn't illegal, nor was searching with permission.

Considering how desperate Princess Anna was and how susceptible she was to one magical, romantic evening, Prince Hans could bank on the princess falling into the arms of the closest and only remaining loved one and the two would be dashing off to the altar. Princess Anna would be too heartbroken to place blame on anybody, yet alone her fiance who would have no blood on his hands; such a death would be out of his hands and I would think Princess Anna would later accept that it was for the best.

America has 99 Cents Only stores and Dollar Tree. All things are 1 dollar before tax, usually coming out to 1.07 after (sales tax being 7-8 percent) except on things like candy and whatnot that doesn't have sales tax. They'll carry some things that are in high demand like packs of water bottles for more than a dollar, but in my stores there's always a disclaimer sign like 'Hey, we know it's not a dollar, but people wanted us to carry these.'

In Letters, Tolkien, talking about a hypothetical occurring when the Ring is at Mount Doom, uses the term 'the Eight', mentioning that the 'Witch-king had been reduced to impotence'. He has been killed, but beyond that he has been laid so low as to be irrelevant from then on. However, it can be argued that being killed didn't release him from the power of the Rings, so he should still be around. He shouldn't find the natural progression of Man into Death until after the destruction of the Ring (some people argue not even then, but I strongly disagree). newlinechar  newlinechar The passage the two of you were talking about, I think, is enough. We don't need to look to other books, just to previous paragraphs. This is actually the second wraith in so many pages to pass above the Hobbits. However, the first incident (where, the clouds still thick, there is no visual description) seems to take some time. Frodo and Sam are described as crouching under a boulder and not speaking for some time, until Frodo finally senses it has passed. Before they start moving again, Theoden is stated to be at that moment dying.  newlinechar  newlinechar With the second passage, the whole scene, a transit from far away . Perhaps a long pause, but still just that, with no indication by the author that any great deal of time has passed, like in the first Nazgul's flight. Even seeing it before they feel it (as was the only indication of the first), there's a speed that marks it as something different. The second passage ends with the statement that the Lord of the Nazgul is dead, and from the pronouncement appears to be making the same sort of claim of immediacy as it did with Theoden. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that, I lean more towards his interpretation. But I'm not going to say it couldn't be one of the other Nazgul flying like a bat out of hell to report. There's simply too much attention drawn to it for me to think we are witnessing anything left than the death-visage of Lord of the Nazgul.

You started this game after the new mechanics have been added. That adds a much steeper learning curve than most of us who started earlier. Tip: Download iZurvive and make sure you have a compass in game that is worn or pristine. (Look in fire stations). On iZurvive make a waypoint where you are and where you want to go. The correspond line will give you and ETA and it will give you a directional degree between 1 and 359. Then pull up your compass and line up in that degree. Once lined up double tap alt so you can lock your camera and auto run until said destination. PM for help if needed

If it makes you feel better, there have been times when I have been completely drunk and said things that I would never in a hundred years have every thought to say!! And the next morning, I wouldn't even remember. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, when I first started dating my boyfriend, his mom got into an accident and he was really worried about her. I was also worried about her since my boyfriend seemed so distressed about it. But for some reason, after I was really drunk one night, I told him that I didn't believe that she was really that hurt and he ended up having to convince me by showing me a picture of her in the hospital. newlinechar  newlinechar The next morning, when he told me what I said, I was mortified! There was never a point when I doubted that his mom was hurt!! **I am so happy he told me I said that though so I could profusely apologize.** newlinechar  newlinechar So, at least in my experience, sometimes alcohol can make people say craaazy, absurd things that end up being hurtful.

I didn't say anything about present day dungeons in what you were responding to (despite me believing that).  I said 2.0 runs.  My initial post said they destroy them in speed runs, which they do from what I've seen.  If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops). newlinechar  newlinechar And while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.

So, let me put it to you this way... right now, you're looking at a high-end overclockable CPU (which you're spending extra for, by the way, without buying a cooler!?), and to go along with that you're buying a shit low-end video card. So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams. newlinechar  newlinechar Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it. newlinechar  newlinechar If your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. You don't need to sacrifice a quad-core processor, just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch, it doesn't fit the rest of your specs. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway... good luck.

It's sad, but really his heart does not lie with Juventus. He has given this club at lot in a very short time, and has won a place in many fans' hearts.

If the blower motor is starting before the flame even lights, then there is an issue.  I have never seen a furnace that purposely blows cold air through the house before the burners light  newlinechar  newlinechar  The inducer motor should start, ignitor, flame, then in about 1-2 minutes the blower should start.   If the blower doesn't start in about 2-3 minutes, then the limit will reach temperature and kick the flame out.  You described the flame like it's actually getting blown out, so I don't believe that is the issue.  But if the blower starts immediately, you have a control issue.

Okay, I think I know what bothers me about Yas's W and passive. newlinechar  newlinechar Yasuo's passive, Q, E, and R *all* create the cohesive image that he interacts with disturbances in air currents. newlinechar  newlinechar His passive gives the sense that 'Flow' is something that can be acquired and disrupted, right?  He gets Flow, and protective wind surrounds him indefinitely until his flow is disrupted, at which point it becomes turbulent, and dissipates shortly afterward.  How does it work?  I don't know, but I feel like, by moving through the air, he can sense what it's doing and sort of 'fit into' it, and that's what creates the normally-invisible shield.  When it's disrupted, he exploits that disruption to prevent damage to himself. newlinechar  newlinechar When Yasuo uses Q, he's also doing *something* with air currents, because it takes 2 of them before he's ready to use the tornado with his third.  Maybe he's reading the currents with his first 2 stabs, maybe he's priming the air (so more writing than reading) with them.  It makes sense, because something changes if he doesn't use the conditions that he's created within a few seconds: all of the prep work goes away, fickle as the wind.  If Yasuo stabs again, though, he can exploit some created or detected disruption in the air to create his tornado, similar to what he does when creating his shield. newlinechar  newlinechar Yasuo's E is a bit more proactive, in that, instead of exploiting an existing disturbance in the air, he forcibly creates one, and that prevents him from using the ability again.  He enhances his movement speed by slipping through the air *just so*, but can't do it again for a certain amount of time because he's changed the air he moved through.  This is why he can E again and again, as long as he has an air current he hasn't already disturbed: the limit isn't with Yasuo, but in the time it takes the air he's disturbing with his dash to return to normal. newlinechar  newlinechar What's more, while this disturbance is being created, Yasuo can exploit it: he can perform sword maneuvers that are beyond his normal abilities (the spin), and create a significantly-larger-than-normal tornado, though it doesn't travel. newlinechar  newlinechar When Yasuo's ult is ready, displacement effects give clear visual queue that they're creating, you guessed it, a disruption in the air that Yasuo can, you guessed it, exploit to benefit himself, this time in the form of extremely rapid movement (presumably aided by the disruption in the air), suspending his enemies in the air, and finally, gaining armor penetration, represented by a disturbance in the air around his sword.  There's a disturbance in the air; Yasuo exploits it. newlinechar  newlinechar His W is the only thing that doesn't fit.  While his E also forcibly manipulates air, it retains his common theme: he can use that disruption to benefit himself (enhanced Q) in some way.  With his W, however, he creates the disturbance and that's it, end of story.  He can't interact with it in any other way, and it's the only air-based ability in the game that he can't interact with (unless you count Janna's shield). newlinechar  newlinechar **TL;DR: Yasuo exploits and interacts with air disturbances, except the one created with his own W.**

This is an amusing post; and I feel like a lot of people making similar posts about ED on here these days would do well to look back on that.  :p    newlinechar  newlinechar Back in those days, it took me something like a day of playing to complete my first successful flight from lave to another system, including docking.  But once I did it once, then it started getting *a lot* easier.   But you had to work to earn that sense of accomplishment.  It was *hard*, and so you really earned the satisfaction of even that simple achievement.   newlinechar  newlinechar And at that point, a whole galaxy...eight of them, actually...opened up before me.   And I was hooked;  I didn't stop until I made *ELITE*.    I was a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a pirate, a pawn and a theif, and occasionally even an honest trader.  I would do the Reidquat run as a warm-up, and then look for a *really* dangerous system to hunt in.  Basically, I practiced until I was actually good at it, instead of quitting just because some feel-good sense of 'winning' wasn't handed to me on a platter like games of today do.   newlinechar  newlinechar Back then games required real skill, and if you couldn't cut it, you lost the game, period.    And a little imagination helped, too; wireframe, or simple solid-colour polygons give you a canvas, and your mind had to fill in the details.   That is not really encouraged as much in the big games of today.    newlinechar  newlinechar And for God's sake, if I see another post about how Elite is bad and should be more like WoW or Eve, I am just going to have to murder someone.   IF you think either of those things, it simply isn't the game for you, you know?    newlinechar  newlinechar I wonder if any  other old-timers are kicking it in Bebece these days?  Is that system even in ED?  I guess I'll have to take a look.   newlinechar  newlinechar

The more possible passwords you have, the harder it is to guess. You can measure that as bits of entropy, the amount of bits (1s and 0s) you'd need to store every possibility. newlinechar  newlinechar Assuming a completely random string that uses any printable ASCII characters, each new character adds 6.570 bits of entropy. With 18 characters the OP mentions, that's 118.26 bits of entropy, which the OP feels isn't enough - he wants to add more characters to the mix, increasing the number of possibilities and thus the 'value' of each character, so to speak.  newlinechar  newlinechar For comparisons sake, according to an estimate made in 2011, 72 bits of entropy would take well over a hundred years to guess, and it gets exponentially more difficult the more bits you add. 118.26 bits should be more than enough for anyone's needs. newlinechar  newlinechar I totally cheated and used wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: Special characters will make your password safer, but you don't really have to worry about it unless you're a cryptography enthusiast.   newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: I copied a value incorrectly, 118.26 became 187.26. Don't ask how ;_;

Maybe it's trivially easy to find men because... the man doesn't have to carry the child inside of him? newlinechar  newlinechar Like, look. I have admitted that it's 'unfair' that biology 'privileges' women by burdening them with a nine-month pregnancy. Both parents have the same options most of the time: Don't have sex if you don't want a pregnancy to ensue. Give the child up for adoption if you don't want to raise it, and pay child support if the other parent raises it. newlinechar  newlinechar But only women (and a very, very small number of men) have to actually deal with being pregnant, and because women are the ones who get pregnant, women are the ones who decide whether or not the pregnancy continues. This is because it is completely unfair to make a woman carry a fetus to term if she doesn't want to, and it's equally unfair to subject her to abortion (an invasive medical procedure) without her consent. newlinechar  newlinechar If cis men could get pregnant, they would have all the same options here. MRAs constantly talk about how it's 'just biology' that's to blame for women earning less money, getting raped, or whatever other injustices women have to deal with. But men face one single problem that literally *is* because of biology, and that's horrendously unfair? Get real. newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, my mother actually has told me stories of pregnant single teens who had their children taken and raised by their parents, who later had to pay child support to their own parents (the children's grandparents) when it came to light, but I'm not actually submitting that as an example because it's hearsay and none of those keywords lead to anything useful on Google. (Because most of the results are just men whining about having to pay child support.) newlinechar  newlinechar If I can magically find an example in this cesspit of 'but whyyyyyyy do i have to take responsibility for my actions???' (in b4 'but abortion' - abortion is a valid way of taking responsibility, it's not the 'easy way out' that conservatives like to pretend it is) then I'll come back and link you. But otherwise, I'm done here.

&gt; Technically the item was charged to them while it was still in their possession. newlinechar  newlinechar LOL, you don't understand how banks and credit cards work. TECHNICALLY, the item was RENTED, not purchased.  newlinechar  newlinechar So 'technically,' your argument means nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hilarious reading the posts on here from ex-Blockbuster employees. You guys seem bummed that it went out of business but it was HORRIBLE. And all of these policies you guys are defending is a huge part of why people were celebrating when the chain fell apart. newlinechar  newlinechar I denied a claim from a Blockbuster through American Express once.

&gt;So then they fight the French some more, and then they fight the Americans some more, and at some point human nature is what it is. It's not an argument against anything.

It achieved little because communism doesn't work and capitalism does.  
You've probably already tried, but have you asked them to do a once weekly grocery list, checking everything you currently have before putting anything on the list? I'd also suggest collecting their receipts and totally their monthly expenses. If you have more time, I'd suggest listing everything you throw out early, and coming up with a value based on what is left, putting everything in an excel spreadsheet, and showing them how wasteful they are. That's basically a second job though.

Can't comment on Anderson's defense as 61.7% is pretty bad but he's also on an oddly poor defensive team considering they have Asik and Davis as shotblockers. I'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. Stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with. newlinechar  newlinechar On offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. He's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. Montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat Anderson is. Montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had. newlinechar  newlinechar You also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. Stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... Dwight (Lewis in Orlando). It's also been a noticeable part of offense for the Spurs (Matt Bonner) and Suns (formerly Channing Frye) in the past. If Houston had the opportunity to trade Montiejunas for Anderson straight up Morey would have Montiejunas on the plane to New Orleans in a heartbeat.

Actually, the video itself is the context, the word you were no doubt searching for is there is no proof, or other conclusive evidence to suggest that the white kid is the bully. However, using context clues, one can make some general assumptions. For instance, the black kid's behavior does suggest that he is distressed, and taking into account the standoffish nature of the white kid, especially at the end when he tries to save face, not to mention the reaction of the other people present, which is obviously supportive of the black kid, it is not outside the bounds of reason to assume that the kid was indeed being bullied and responded in an appropriate and satisfying manner. Of course, it is impossible to be sure that the above mentioned scenario is the correct one, but I posit that it is probably the most likely of the other available explanations.

But you're missing the impact of the first movie.  That was 2002, before Hulk, Fantastic Four, The Punisher, and subsequent comic book movies that don't totally suck. newlinechar  newlinechar At that point there was only X-Men, and before that the unwieldy period of 70s movies and the shameful resurgence of licensed movies like Batman &amp; Robin that stigmatized them.  So this is one of two movies responsible for rebuilding the genre and bringing it into the modern age. newlinechar  newlinechar And as one of many people who saw it at the theatre, there's no substitute for that first time watching it and seeing Spider-Man _move_ on screen like straight out of the comics.

My advice to not wasting time and money on square bitches is to focus on bitches that like YOU rather than bitches that you like. As soon as you've made a connection with them, profess your feelings for them first. If they get all gushy over you telling them that you feel a strong connection with them, then pull back a bit and get them to chase you. On the other hand if you tell them you feel a strong connection and they're like 'yeah whatever BUY ME SOMETHING' then you know they're trying to get you to chase them and most of the time, no matter how fine the bitch is, it won't work between you. newlinechar  newlinechar If you play things too slow waiting for them to build up a connection with you, it's a hit or miss game and you can lose a lot of time and money in the process. On the other hand, as soon as you feel you've put in a bit of quality time, if you right away tell them you feel that strong connection, you'll probably end up losing a large amount of your prospects in the process, but at the end of the day you're weeding out the ones that are too much trouble or effort in the first place. 
I'm far from these people when it comes to this story. I just can't understand this Transgender stuff. I just think if you got a dick you're a guy and if you have a vagina you're a girl.

I apologize if this infuriates anybody but if i hear someone who looks just like a girl say 'I was born a guy' I'm gonna feel like I was fooled. I just think if you feel like you are of the opposite sex and are attracted to the same sex you should just be gay/lesbian, don't make others mad by changing your name and gender identity when public record says otherwise.

I don't really see Raikkonen as that controversial. Most fans would rate him as a driver that in his prime was very good, but not up there with the absolute best like Schumacher and Alonso.

Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language -- so the argument runs -- must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.

Considering pretty much every civilization over thousands of years has had something against the Jews, it makes you wonder what the hell they do to piss people off so much.  Hell, the reason they've become so associated with money handling is because in the middle ages, the church didn't let Christians lend money with interest, so they **forced** all the Jews to get into that line of work.

I don't know why but this feels like the least flattering recommendation I have read in a long time. Don't get me wrong, *Learn You a Haskell* may be *the* way to go. I am concerned for the lack of exercises to accompany it, though. Additionally, and I know this may just be pickiness over the style, I feel like it 'tries too hard' to be funny. Some days I don't mind attempts to be funny. Other days, I just want to get right to the point. Plus, if I recall correctly, didn't someone recently criticize *Learn You a Haskell*'s english style as 'broken to the point of unreadable'? Or am I thinking of something else?

His TARDIS will be a major advantage. newlinechar  newlinechar **Superman**, the guy who can benchpress planets, heat vision, freeze breath, sun-dipping, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar **Thor**, Norse god of thunder and wielder of Mjolnir.

Alright. newlinechar Then why are you complaining about the heavy doing that? If he was messing around, and if it was a pub, then it's all cool isn't it? Never questioned your intellectual level, only questioned how good of a medic you are. newlinechar  newlinechar It is. You obviously don't have enough experience to even start comparing the medi gun to the quickfix. You can still defend with an uber, krtiz can be more agro, the vaccinator goes along well depending on the enemy specifically. The QF, on the other hand, is just an all around medi gun. Good medics don't keep everyone alive lmao, you're talking about nice medics. Good medics have heal priority, who to give up to achieve an objective, capture a point, who to uber, when, knowing your way out, countless are the things that make you a good medic. I could write a book with such things. newlinechar  newlinechar In a serious environment where you can communicate with your team, the QF is utter trash and shouldn't even be used if the enemy aren't braindead. Enemy spy can check your medi gun and tell the medic who will proceed on to pick kritzkrieg. A kritz demo makes the QF's uber a joke. newlinechar You can hold off enemies with stock as well, if you have good mobility, positioning, surviving should not be an issue. As I said you can't keep everyone alive as a medic, you have to take the right decisions, and this is what makes medic a jewel, you're not there to keep everyone alive hurr durr i iz gud medic, no. A good medic paired with decent players can be devastating. If your team is shit, and if you always play with braindead players, then I feel sorry. But since I know you don't, and that the QF can be replaced at really any moment with the medi gun IF you have an ounce of gamesense, then you should use it. newlinechar  newlinechar Look, pal, it ain't that hard to keep people alive. I've had to keep at multiple times up to 5 players alive all at once, you just have to keep healing priority in mind. It's not rocket science, and IMO using the QF overall is an excuse because you're justifying your lack of skill as a medic to compensate for mobility, positioning, and not being able to accept mistakes you'd make with the medi gun.

It would be nice if life could be boiled down as simply as game theory attempts to do, but it can't.  Humans are far more complex and sometimes make choices that contradict what they actually 'prefer'. newlinechar  newlinechar We see this with politics all of the time.
&gt; Sure they do. newlinechar  newlinechar No they aren't. Not even light works the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. newlinechar  newlinechar What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.
sorry for the late thread guys
I know 6-7 teams can still make bowls.  Not sure if Colorado would get the exemption though.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  Found the rules for what to do after all normal eligible schools have been taken. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  Teams finishing 6-6 with one win against a team from the lower Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), regardless of whether that FCS school meets NCAA scholarship requirements. Until now, an FCS win counted only if that opponent met the scholarship requirements—specifically, that school had to award at least 90% of the FCS maximum of 63 scholarship equivalents over a two-year period. In the 2012 season, programs in four FCS conferences cannot meet the 90% requirement (56.7 equivalents)—the Ivy League, which prohibits all athletic scholarships; the Patriot League and Pioneer Football League, which do not currently award football scholarships; and the Northeast Conference, which limits football scholarships to 38 equivalents. newlinechar  newlinechar 2.  6-6 teams with two wins over FCS schools. newlinechar  newlinechar 3.  Teams that finish 6-7 with loss number seven in their conference championship game (that has been eliminated by the conference championship waiver rule). newlinechar  newlinechar 4.  **6-7 teams that normally play a 13-team schedule, such as Hawaii's home opponents.** newlinechar  newlinechar 5.  FCS teams who are in the final year of the two-year FBS transition process, if they have at least a 6-6 record. newlinechar  newlinechar 6.  Finally, 5-7 teams that have a top-5 Academic Progress Rate (APR) score. This was later adjusted to allow other 5-7 teams to be selected thereafter—in order of their APR. [11] newlinechar

I really appreciate this article, and I really empathized with the author when he talked about the 'hidden code' of liturgy. newlinechar  newlinechar In my lifetime, both as a child and an adult, I have visited about 50 churches.  If the order of worship is not A: spelled out in the bulletin/pamphlet, or B: clearly enunciated by the pastor, it is very easy to become lost.  And, if you make any misstep, you feel self-conscious and left out. newlinechar  newlinechar I think many churches, both reformed and unreformed, use this habitual, 'hidden code' liturgy as a way for the congregation to bond over this shared, undefined habit, i.e. who's 'in the know'.  To me, this is almost gnostic, and serves to create a feeling of insiders vs. outsiders. newlinechar  newlinechar The congregation should be able to bond over their shared love of Christ, not who can memorize and perform the public 'secret handshake' ritual in absolute silence. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I really appreciate the author's gentleness when he spoke of his colleagues who made some very racist statements.  'African-Americans don't want liturgy, they want to be free to express themselves' comes across as imagining all black churches to be lead by James Brown, and all singing and dancing to resemble 'Soul Train'. newlinechar  newlinechar The author has taken the high road and wrote a series of informative articles, and I appreciate his work.  Thanks for posting this, all 5 parts were a great read!

Generally honesty and rationality will ensure you have a good kick starter. newlinechar  newlinechar Here are some questions you should ask. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Are you trying to scam people? newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Are you deceptive or dishonest in any way when selling your idea? newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Is your idea realistic? newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Do you have a plan on how you are going to spend the funds? newlinechar  newlinechar 5) Do you have a prototype that properly demonstrates that your idea is feasible, or a well elaborated and supported theoretical basis for your idea? newlinechar  newlinechar 6) Are your rewards realistic and fair?

I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema. newlinechar  newlinechar But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises). newlinechar  newlinechar I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I mean, #3 'Creating Worker Co-ops' is kind of socialist. Not really fully socialist, since he's not talking about seizing the present economic structures but building competing ones, but bringing workers' ownership into the conversation is helpful. And the way #4 'Growing the Trade Union Movement' is described certainly isn't socialist, but the labor movement will be critically important in any future socialist movement, so strengthening it is important. And while #7 may be named 'Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers,' the upswing of fighting the NAFTA or TPP (even for nationalistic reasons) would be a benefit to global workers in sectors that would be marginalized by the kind of free trade that is implemented on capital-owners' terms. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I see it, Bernie Sanders certainly isn't the answer. He's still quasi-capitalist and supports some imperialist policies. If he runs with the Democrats, he'll be telling people that 'socialism' is a thing for liberals and that the right-wing Democratic Party is the place for 'socialists,' which will do a lot of damage. But if he runs in a socialist party, he can help build up a movement that will outlive him. He won't be around forever, and if he's used to make a socialist movement more popular, it can be taken over by genuine socialists. Sanders and Kshama Sawant have spoken together in the past, and as maybe the next most prominent socialist in government (though distant by comparison), she might be indicative of what the next generation of such a movement would look like. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't trust Sanders to be president. He would probably be better than a Democrat or Republican, but I don't play the game of arguing for lesser evils. However, I do think that socialists can use him to bolster the movement, so long as he's got enough of his old socialist conscience left to not enter the Democratic Party.

Haha! My personal motto is 'Nobody ever looks back on their life and thinks, 'I wish I'd had less sex'.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately 20 is a *bit* too young for me, otherwise I'd take you up on your generous offer. :) newlinechar  newlinechar So, I didn't go to school, and it hasn't been a hindrance for me. I figured with the 50k I'd spend on school, not counting the insane amounts of interest, I could get a head start on my investment portfolio. Fortunately for me I was right.  newlinechar  newlinechar It also helps to be able to write and speak legibly: I'm a true believer that the gift of gab is worth its weight in gold. If you can speak to people in a manner they enjoy, the world opens up, regardless of the letters behind your name.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, I'm not *against* school, and especially if you live in a country that pays for it, by all means, continue your education. And you're right, a business degree seems like a good choice. Truth be told I was never much good at school (it's hard for me to sit still and concentrate), so it was an easy choice for me to put my money elsewhere.  newlinechar  newlinechar YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T HAVE TO END UP IN A BORING OFFICE JOB! There are plenty of people who enjoy the solace and anonymity provided by an office job - leave those jobs to the people who love them. Because if you don't, and if you would be miserable in such, then for fucks sake, don't do that to yourself. Even if you have a tough time finding a job - and believe me, I've been there - find something else with which to make money while you search. There are an infinite amount of ways to make cash, and the more you cultivate those, the better you get/the more money you make. For instance, I have flipped furniture, painted, sold things on ebay/craigslist, guest bartended ... really, there are so many things you can do to make money. The notion of 'The American way is to get a job in your twenties and work the same job until you're 65 and get your pension and live in your little house with your little wife until you die' are over, man. We live in a society that now embraces creativity (which they should, as all invention comes from creative thought), and there's so much out there that's just ripe for the taking. Yes, you have to work hard. Yes, you have to sacrifice. And for fuck's sake, be on time to things - tardiness is a sure way to get the boot.  newlinechar  newlinechar

My understanding is that simple carbs have low nutritional value and because you are missing out on the vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, antioxidants etc. is why it is unhealthy for you. newlinechar  newlinechar Specifically talking about the pancreas, I believe sugar does not lead to diabetes (according to my nutrition text book), but is often associated with obesity (which is associated with a lack of physical activity) which can increase the risk of developing diabetes. newlinechar  newlinechar What type of damage does refined carbs cause over time? What illness or diseases can this lead to? newlinechar  newlinechar And thanks if you do take your time to respond!

That was a really interesting article, thanks for sharing. One of the things that turned me away from Christianity were the bible readings we had every week at church. I just remember hearing some of these stories like where everyone in Sodom is killed as if every last person (including, I assume, infants) is deserving of death. Then Jesus comes along and all of a sudden we're all supposed to love each other.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know enough about biblical scholarship to debate some of the comments. But I find the argument interesting that the bible is our most historical document as we have so many copies. I've often heard that as an argument for the bible's infallibility. What I don't understand is how that in any way solves all the inconsistencies and contradictions within the bible itself.

&gt; We were remarking on how all new builds are so big and how it's so weird newlinechar  newlinechar Exactly. Ours is a 'starter home' and yet it's 1200 ft^2 , with an unfinished basement and a 3 stall garage. This is the only home we plan on living in now. Apparently, we'll be having new neighbors constantly since we're just in a 'starter' neighborhood. Ridiculous. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My husband and I live in a mass produced 'cracker box' very much like the first picture. It's about 1100 square feet, built in the early 50s and solid as a tank. newlinechar  newlinechar I love these neighborhoods, and am jealous of you. We tried to put offers on a couple of the houses like these that were in decent shape, but they were sold literally hours after being on the market. You're correct in that these houses are in high demand. The weird part is that in some of these neighborhoods, people seem to be buying the houses to use as rental properties - and the quality of neighborhoods seem to be going downhill because of it. I would LOVE to see newer neighborhoods with these houses. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;When we first moved in here, we had the typical 'starter home' mentality, figuring we'd upgrade in five to ten years. We only have one bathroom, and while we have four bedrooms, they're small, and their number comes at the expense of a dining room and a living room that can comfortably fit more than us and a few friends. newlinechar  newlinechar Our newer house does have some advantages: newlinechar  newlinechar The basement has a large family room, so that when it's finished, it can fit all of our 'activities' - Our 8 ft. pool table, a gaming/board game table and chairs/couch, and my gun safe. We have those items in the basement right now, it just isn't finished off.  newlinechar  newlinechar The 3rd stall in the garage will be my shop/woodworking area, so all the tools I have from my grandpa will actually be usable. With the small cracker box house neighborhoods, I've never seen more than a double stall, and most of them are single stalls; We want a garden as well, and a lot of the older neighborhoods have a pretty small lot size already. newlinechar  newlinechar When the basement is entirely finished off, we will have 2 more bedrooms and a 3rd bathroom. So, it'll be a 4 bedroom, 3 bath, dedicated laundry room 'starter home'. Still blows my mind that people think they need more than this. I can even use one of the basement bedrooms for a home office if I decide to quit working for someone else. We'll see what happens.  newlinechar  newlinechar ----------------------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar On a side note, 2 of the people that are married that my SO and I went to school with are looking at houses now. They're looking at a $450,000 house, 'but aren't sure it's big enough'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Makes me want to throat punch them.

&gt;Nobody should be forced into parental obligations for a child they never wanted. newlinechar  newlinechar So neither should taxpayers, who by all accounts had absolutely nothing to do with the birth of child at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;All people should be forced to pay taxes that fund a great many things, one of which would be a greater social safety net for childre. newlinechar  newlinechar Why shouldn't taxes be opt-in? All I'm pointing out is that you're being exceptionally inconsistent with how and where you apply the principle which forms the basis for your argument. It stands to reason that if I shouldn't have to pay for a child I never wanted, that extends to taxes that pay for said child. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But take a couple who agrees they don't want kids. They have consensual sex but the condom breaks, or birth control fails. The woman decides to raise the child, but the man does not want to be a parent. newlinechar  newlinechar And thems the breaks, I'm sorry to say. Life isn't always fair, nor does it always go according to plan. That you don't get to live the life you wanted isn't necessarily an indication that you're being treated unjustly.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;He should not be forced to pay. newlinechar  newlinechar Why not? Is it not his biological offspring? Why should I be forced to pay for his child if I have to opt-in for paying for children? newlinechar  newlinechar My point, again, isn't that it's a bad thing. I forward it. My point is that switching to an 'opt-in system' changes almost everything around our society and can be used just as easily to argue that I, as a taxpayer, shouldn't have to pay for that child. You haven't demonstrated why the principle only applies to cases that you want it to apply to, but not to others.

Actually a common misconception about cats is that throwing up is normal for them. It's not. I have a 7 year old cat and a 3 year old cat, they never ever throw up. The older one threw up once, and we knew something was seriously wrong, so we rushed her to the kitty hospital at like 3am, and it turns out she had eaten Lilies (the flower). If you didnt know, lily flowers are so toxic to felines that even just the pollen on their fur could result in renal failure. (It reacts to their bodies the same way that antifreeze does). She ended up being fine, but only because we caught it so early and didn't brush it off as 'oh must be a hairball'. After the first two hours of lily poisoning the survival rate goes down to 20%. But I digress, vomiting in cats is not normal. Yes some cats have hairballs, but they really aren't *supposed* to. There are simple home remedies, and food types for them that will stop hairballs. Anyway moral of the story is, if your cat throws up, don't just assume that cats do that- make sure that kitty is alright!

I feel like Netflix series fit street level heroes better than normal films. They don't require as many special effects and they also have a longer amount of time to develop the characters. newlinechar  newlinechar If the MCU does get ahold of Spidey, it would be interesting to get a Netflix series instead of an actual film for him. Or-- if the costs to show Spidey's powers are too high, a Netflix cartoon series? But not one designed for kids or to sell toys, a more mature one.

I'm saying that I think the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the first team is greater than the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the second team. Gandalf is far stronger than Dumbledore for instance, and if The Doctor either can't get to the TARDIS or has it destroyed, his only option is pretty much putting all the energy of his remaining regenerations and exploding. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, yeah, I think Goku could stalemate Superman. But really, Vader/Dumbledore is a wash, Zeus is probably stronger than Thor, and like I said, Galdalf is just a beast and could probably negate The Doctor using the TARDIS.

I'm white and I live in Canada. I've never called 911 in my life, never filed a police report, and never been detained by the police. newlinechar  newlinechar I live in a poor community with a lot of petty crime, but violent crime is almost unheard of, and I KNOW that if there was ever a real problem, the police would respond and deal with me and the incident fairly.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that's the important difference. My community has faith in the police, and even though there are very few officers patrolling the streets, we know that they will actually respond when we need them to. newlinechar  newlinechar I honestly can't imagine what it would be like to live somewhere where there was gun crime, and people genuinely felt that the police would only make matters worse. newlinechar  newlinechar I hear a lot of comments on Reddit to the effect that 'Don't call the cops, they'll just kill your dog and make problems worse' but this is so divorced from my experience that it sounds insane to me. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that the problems in a lot of American cities are systemic and obviously cultural and racial. It's not fair to expect a police force to be able to sort this out. There needs to be bridge-building between cultures and communities. newlinechar  newlinechar I want to see some wealthy property and business owners walk into the poor communities that exist adjacent to their suburbs and honestly try to engage in dialogue with people. newlinechar  newlinechar We don't need a million man march, we need ten thousand hundred man marches.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar

That right there is one of my downfalls... I tend to use the handbrake to correct if I end up in a bad angle, or too close to an inside corner and need to slide away from it a bit.

I'd be inclined to buy it if they did. Hopefully the price won't be as expensive as it is now (base price is still $60!). newlinechar  newlinechar F2P would also be nice, but it would probably lead to worse design issues in the game. B2P may be a better revenue model. We'll see.

Hate speech is, by definition, speech (or writing) that incites violence against or intimidates a protected group. The judgment call on this seems like something that, IMO, should be left up to the admins and mods in respect to individual comments, rather than banning whole subs, unless the subs are actively and specifically dedicated towards inciting violence against people, which the ones that /u/HokesOne lists aren't (although damn I hate defending /r/whiterights, that shit is truly vile).

Randall Cobb too 
In AZ you can get a DUI for a variety of things that don't include driving. When I got mine, I was at a bar one night and had too much to drink. I called a cab to pick me up. When it got there, I had him stop by my car so I could grab my laptop bag that I didn't want to leave out overnight. There was a cop in the parking lot already, but I didn't think anything of it. He came racing over and busted me for DUI because I was 'in control of a vehicle' even though I was only grabbing a backpack out and it was blocked in the parking spot by my cab.  newlinechar  newlinechar I ended up having to take several weeks of alcohol abuse classes among other things, because anyone who has more than one drink at a time has a problem apparently. During the classes we covered different cases of people getting DUIs and what could get you in trouble. Obviously don't drink and drive. But don't be in your front yard with your car keys on you if you've had a drink. If you're within a certain distance of the vehicle you're still in control of the vehicle. Don't drink a beer on a hot day while mowing your lawn, a mower is a vehicle. One guy got a DUI while trying to fix his car in his driveway. The engine didn't start, but he was drinking a beer while working on it. One old woman got a DUI after church because someone hit her and the communion wine registered on the breathalyzer as a .01 and she had a grandkid with her. That one was a felony because of the kid. Another person got a DUI after leaving a hospital and driving too slowly. She told the cop she was tired after working a double shift then visiting her sick mother. You can get a DUI if the cop thinks you're too tired, and she got her 2nd DUI that way even though she had nothing in her system. newlinechar  newlinechar Drinking and driving is flat out stupid. But a lot of the laws now are just insane and geared towards making the states money.

I don't interpret it the same way you do.   newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to think that men have this idea that femininity is bad, but I see it more as femininity implies lack of masculinity, which is bad (for men). Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase 'you throw like a girl' is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to 'you don't throw like a boy.'   newlinechar    newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.   newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's all very silly, but things like this always are. I try to avoid those mindsets but none of us are immune from it. We're all just trying to find our way in a world filled with people telling us how to do it.

Oh man, high school. I was once sent to see the principal because a teacher saw me put my hand to my mouth and assumed I was ingesting some imaginary drug-- I had wiped my lips with a bit of napkin.

In retrospect, I can offer the following advice that you are welcome to dismiss: newlinechar  newlinechar * Obtain and wear clothes that actually fit. I know that can be difficult, but well-fitting clothes really do make any build look better. newlinechar  newlinechar * Stand up for yourself. Teachers may be authority figures, but as you implied there are definite limits on their authority, and more importantly there are limits to what is appropriate workplace behavior. 'This is my natural build. If you don't stop harassing me, I'll have to inform the principal.' (Say that politely!) newlinechar  newlinechar * This may be cliche at this point, but it really does get better. Almost everyone in high school is an asshole to some degree or another and eventually most of them grow out of it. In the meantime, try not to be one of those people as well, even if it often seems justified.

That's a bit extreme. I fully believe those parents had empathy for their child. Not only did their views on the transgender differ but the parent feared their child's soul was forfeit for questioning God. As absurd as it sounds they tried to save this child with all their might, so much so that they hardly showed any compassion in doing so. When you see someone destroying themselves, which is what her parents saw, empathy will make you stop them at almost any means.

Exactly this newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe Ricciardo, Vergne and Vettel are the three best drivers in the sport, but considering Newey's track record, we can reliably assume who really won those 4 world champions, since those drivers haven't been team mates with anyone not in the red bull academy. At the same time with Raikonnen, he's been up against a few proven teammates, including Massa, and he did about as well as expected (maybe a little worse, but hey it was his first year in the car again) against Alonso as you would guess when you look at how he compared to Massa, so there wasn't much of a surprise there. newlinechar  newlinechar For that reason I think Vettel is still the more controversial driver, because he hasn't faced a number of known top class teammates, and neither have any of his teammates, so you can't really say how good he is since you don't even know how good his teammates and the former teammates of his teammates are. newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, that'll all change next year, and if Vettel does anything less than stomp Kimi, the Alonso circlejerk will be full blast :)

What I find interesting about Buddhism is it's versatility. You can find Western Buddhists that don't believe in anything supernatural like reincarnation and see it as mind states - you do lots of good and you feel good (divine), and you can feel ghostly after a terrible deed that leaves you full of guilt. I think Buddhism is a great way of understanding how the world works and how to approach life.

Most cities follow a pattern due to segregation, its actually incredibly common for the south and west sides of cities to be the most dangerous because this is where minorities and african americans resided. Things in those parts of cities were not as well maintained or monitored. So maybe not the world but definitely cities in the USA are like this. If you look at the entire continent of Africa its made up of some of the most unstable and/or violent countries in the world. So to make the joke that Cape Town is the south side of this ghetto of a continent makes sense if you know anything about the world.

The game wasn't willing to let you roam far enough in the levels to create a world. If you found two paths, they both lead to the same area, it's just that one involved more enemies but more loot. It felt like every room had a purpose for gameplay reasons, and anything that didn't serve the gameplay mechanics of the level was cut. To their credit, Eidos did a great job of putting a TON of world-building dialogue, memos, and posters in the world to try to make up for that, but there's still no real substitute for letting the player see portions of the world that exist for reasons other than gameplay. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm disappointed that the hidden cache chain of the City petered out too. That was the best thing they did in the open-world part of the game, completely un-gamey and relying solely on the player's map reading abilities, and they just let it die off.

Replacing both the screen and digitizer is usually really easy. In this instance, it appears the screen/digitizer combo is fairly hard to come by (couldn't find it easily on Amazon), which is why the heat gun/hair dryer is involved (the glass is glued to the digitizer, and both sit over the LCD screen). newlinechar  newlinechar So, replacing just the glass should be pretty easy, just a little touchier. You'll have to heat the glass such that it will separate from the digitizer, then glue the new glass onto the digitizer.

&gt; The whole point of naturalism is to understand the sorts of things that naturally occur, no miracles required. newlinechar  newlinechar Naturalism accepts that the universe can come from nothing and information can spontaneously generate. These are not observable, are based on faith, and are miraculous by definition. Since what is natural is defined by the universe, the universe itself requires something supernatural for its birth. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The complexity of life arises from a much larger number of simple properties and repetitions. newlinechar  newlinechar So simple we don't understand them. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Perhaps the universe is larger, more chaotic, and more complex than we imagined, but the only thing convoluted here is the approach religious people take when trying to understanding it. newlinechar  newlinechar Right... the convoluted idea that instead of inflating the probabilities for a miracle to occur via an ad-hoc speculation every time we're proven wrong, perhaps this evidence of an intelligent design is suggestive of a designer? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If a deity were 'simple' it wouldn't be much of a deity. I can also use the simple answer 'magic' or 'because' with a toddler, but sometimes a one word answer is no answer at all. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that He's able to do things far beyond our grasp that we couldn't begin to understand that seems magical to us does not make Him necessarily simple or any less real.

It could have been an imploding pile of lol-cats for all I know or care. I rely on observation, and stop where it stops, and what's currently observed only points to a big bang.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many including myself are aware that our observations can be explained most eloquently and logically by a designer. To rule out this possibility is to exercise faith. If we have a designer, which is absolutely a distinct possibility by your own admission, then we are His creation therefor accountable to Him. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You're the one continuing to be dishonest, by having faith in and pretending to have knowledge of huge numbers of things beyond reality and the observable natural world. newlinechar  newlinechar I conclude that the evidence supports God, and I also maintain the Bible as a testimony to His nature and actions. These are testable hypotheses and remain valid with evidence to this day. Choosing not to explore this possibility is the free will of each individual at their own peril.

So it seems we're clamoring that the shotgun isn't useful and needs to be buffed. But everyone's treating the symptoms of problem and not the core problem itself.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Heavy's burst damage is limited because of the ramp-up penalty.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Heavy's mobility is severely limited which causes him to get caught out of position a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar * His lack of mobility also causes him to eat more damage as he's limited in strafing or dodging the oncoming fire. This is especially the case when firing/spinning the minigun. newlinechar  newlinechar The natural/historical response to this is to use the sanvich to heal when the heavy has a chance. As long as his team is holding ground and he has cover, the heavy can replenish his health by remaining stationary for a specific period of time.  newlinechar  newlinechar People are trying to make the shotgun more useful, but this doesn't really address the core mechanics of heavy and tf2: newlinechar  newlinechar * Increasing his burst damage or making him a fat scout doesn't in any way increase his mobility - allowing him to still get caught of position. newlinechar  newlinechar * Multiple classes with greater mobility being able to dump well over 300 damage within a few short seconds still leaves heavy at a disadvantage. newlinechar  newlinechar * The problem with the shottie is that you can really only engage 1 person at a time. Compare this to stickies or rockets. A soldier/demo can place a rocket/sticky between two people and significantly damage both of them. Shotguns do not split damage like that. newlinechar  newlinechar * Although the heavy's shotgun increases his burst damage, pushing a corner with a shotgun is an unsound move as there is no telling what's on the opposite side. Previously you could jump/rev and be ready. Now you have to spinup and prefire the corner: giving the opponents time to retreat and allowing you to burn through ammo shooting at a wall/floor. newlinechar  newlinechar Heavy needs a mobility/HP buff to make the shotgun viable. Holding his own against demos/scouts/soldiers/pyros with the shottie is suspect. Even if he kills one opponent, the damage he took in the encounter will likely prevent him from being able to survive the next foe he encounters without a healthboost. newlinechar  newlinechar Prior to the unnecessary, clumsy nerf. Heavy's ability to time ambushes made him able to take out more than one opponent while operating at reduced health. Soldier has the ability to ambush people from high perches he has jumped to. Demo has sticky bombs for traps. Pyro has the backburner and axtinguisher for ambushes. Heavy has a spin up penalty.  newlinechar  newlinechar Simply adding a shotgun or weapon switch times only temporary increases his mobility. But he's still going to soak up damage, and he'll still be at a significant disadvantage to all the other ambush/explosive classes. This is why the majority of players will still equip the sanvich and deal with the atrocious ramp up penalty on their minigun. It's the best option for this nerfed class. newlinechar  newlinechar

Andrew has this nasty habit of jerking his head like he just got shot when he drives and someone puts a body on him. Don't pretend you've never seen him do this. The reason people point to that one is because it was an egregious example that got widespread media attention on major sports sites and blogs. No one documents every single flop from every game. Every team is guilty of selling contact. Some examples are worse than others. It's something to laugh about and generate discussion on changes. It's not something that any team can use to throw stones.

Nope. I totally agree with you. I tried phrasing it exactly like that for the entire first 18 months of her life. The minute I say, 'It really helps if' or 'I've actually had some luck trying' ('luck', I say, as if it's just lucky that I happen to have stumbled upon knowing what works, in an effort to spare his pride) or 'I've found that if you', I get immediately blowback and accused of being bossy. I'm sick of being accused of being bossy. When he gets that flustered, he's sarcastic with the kid and he's sarcastic with me.

TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though. newlinechar  newlinechar Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

Yes, but there are additional effects. For example, heating from the Sun causes the atmosphere to change in size as well, whereas the purely gravitational effect from the Sun is smaller than that of the Moon. I'm not an expert on these things, but the one impact I thought of was radio communication because the [ionosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#The_ionospheric_layers) changes from the solar heating and you can bounce certain radio signals off the bottom of the ionosphere (since they don't propagate through). I'd be interested to hear other possibilities for impact.

I think it's your associations that matter, mostly. Linguistically, negatives are not very compelling, but visual stimulation that has a powerful negative or transformational association does. newlinechar  newlinechar I support your experiment and think it's great, especially if it works for you! I'll present a couple ideas for your consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 3 panel comic sigil, showing the thing, the process by which it is transformed, and the result (symbolically, or sigilized statements) for example 1. You smoking 2. The 'death' of your relationship to smoking. You can depict the spirit of tobacco as you see it, for example. The death of its influence on you. 3. The transformation of the habit to one you would prefer. Like instead of a smoke break, an 'outside breath break' where you take the time to center your breathing and awareness. Or whatever habit you prefer. newlinechar  newlinechar Using death in the sigil statement. 'My relationship to tobacco dies and is transformed' might be a way to get around the negative quandary. 'My awareness destroys my relationship to tobacco.' Don't be afraid to use powerful and evocative words, they may also provide more inspiration for the form of the sigil, as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The underpinning of these ideas is working with the Tarot as a language for sigil construction, because it has concepts of transformation and destruction already visually depicted but inherently lacks negatives, at least from a linguistic process. Haven't fleshed this out yet, I'm sure others have done it.  Just think in terms of processes by which something might change, vs simply saying no.

That's true, hadn't really thought about the attack exp, however a lot of obby maulers (including pures) end up with 16 attack, either from that quest or from death plateau for climbing boots. Also, I've heard that 16 attack doubles the strength exp/hour at rock crabs compared to 1 attack which you may want to take into account, as training obby maulers can often be very slow.

My little brother has paranoid schizophrenia and when he is on his meds he is the nicest person you will ever meet, but if gets off them it gets real bad. For example, there was a time I was out of work and lost my job and car. So he let me stay rent free at his place, sold me a good car for about 500$ and got me a job. If it werent for that I wouldnt have what I have now. However, last year he was off his meds and ended up going to jail for a year. It was because he was curious what our youngest brother looked like from the inside so he chased him down the road with a knife. Luckily there was a cop driving by or Im not sure what wouldve happened. I would hate to see him on meth or crack. Schizophrenia is some scary shit.

Well, I have a PhD in law. It might sounds awesome, especially in the US, but here where I am it actually isn't. It doesn't mean anything. I work at the univeristy and sure, there is a lot of opportunity. But nothing is guaranteed. Mighjt happen, might not. Getting that position was already a struggle and I know many people would kill for it. Still, it's paid really low. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways. My mom has always been hot blooded. She tells hurtful things and then regrets it, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. I came to my parents for Christmas. My dad is very sick so I needed to help my mom with everything. And I did. I think she was glad I came only because of that. I was my Name Day on Christmas Eve and my birthday on 26th. She didn't give a shit. I didn't get anything from her, not even wishes. She is only nice for me when she needs some help, but she doesn't give anything back. It's the worst when someone is comming over and she wants to show off. The holiday season was full of visits and it got really frustrating to prepare everything, yet not even hear a simple 'thank you'. On Sun we had guests over - a couple with a kid, so she locked my dog in a room. Sure, the dog isn't accustomed to it, but we didn't know how our guests feel about dogs. But they were OK, actually they wanted my dog to be out, but my mom says no, because the dog annoys her. The guests kept peeking into that room, so the dog was barking constantly and my mom yelled at me. I had to take my dog for a long walk despite the darkness and frost. I wanted to go back to my place right then but I had drunk some alcohol so I couldn't. I told her how I felt about it, but she didn't react at all. newlinechar  newlinechar Today she was all nice as she invited four people over and she needed help with preparation. I did a lot, went shopping with her and spent half of the day in the kitchen. She cleaned the living room and locked it as she didn't want the dog to come into it as she would shed some hair... When fist guest arrives the dog was excited (she knows them and they're OK with dogs), so my mom locked her in another room. She started to whine as she was afraid of the fireworks and wanted to be with us. But my mom said no. I said that in such a case I'm going to spend the whole New Year's Eve in the separate room and my mom said she's fine with it, which was really hurtful, as I helped her so much and yet she cared only about the guests. I told her that. Then she said that it's her place and if I don't like it, I can go fuck out of there. So I started to pack myself. She didn't stop me only said that she's fine with it and added that I might as well not comming again any time. She was furious, probably because the guests saw it all. Then she started to cry, but I just left. When my uncle and aunt arrived (I was already on my way), they called me and asked me to come back, but I didn't want to. After I arrived at my place my mom called me and asked if I arrived safetly, then she gave the phone to my aunt who said that my mom is as she is and I should pay no attention to it and just come back. I didn't. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't feel good about it. But it was just enough. I felt like I'm some sort of servant the entire time. I feel unloved and unworthy, not even my mom shows any affection towards me. It all might seem really silly, but actually it runs really deep.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't choose anything.

A small group of owners owns them and utilizes them, and they get wealthy while nothing else happens economically.

'The right to place demands on others' is what a positive right is, and it's only used for things where people need defending from having their rights violated. This is why childcare applies in this situation. *Somebody* has to take responsibility for this child, and that means you either give the child up for adoption or make the parents do it. And child support doesn't only apply to men. Women have to sacrifice their lives and finance by law if they choose to keep the child as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's not forget that the man in our situation could have avoided it early on. He has full rights to prevent a pregnancy before it happens. Of course he has fewer rights once it's occurring within someone else's body. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that the woman's rights, that it would be barbaric to take from her, protect her decisions during this period isn't ideal, but it's a biological fact and you can't get around that without repercussions that are worse than the status quo. 
I tried to explain it further down, but it's not something I completely understand myself. I mean, socialisation comes into it - people tell us that we have to be manly and mock us if we're not. Men end up looking for ways to define and assert this manliness. Just look at how many movies there are about becoming a man (Mulan doesn't count).   newlinechar  newlinechar However, since manliness is mostly a social construct and the gender divide is reducing rapidly, it's hard to see what it is to be a man. As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.   newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, with age most of them develop a more internal idea of manhood and don't feel such a massive and constant need to prove their masculinity.

It's not as simple as that and you know it. A person can choose to do a great many things. A woman could choose to wait until she has the baby and then smother it and throw it out in the trash. Some cultures and beliefs systems include that as a valid choice. However to a woman who believes that abortion is murder, the abortion as a 'choice' it's no different than waiting until the baby is born and killing the infant at that time.

How is the coolermaster box working? The problem may be within that box and how it processes the network. Or you need to open the ports to the raspberry pi on the living room router. Once you open the ports on the living room router you would SSH from your computer to the living room router IP address assigned from the main router...

Thank you, I'll check out those links.

I definitely agree, you laid out all of the shitty things about clubbing in general. If you got a stable and you're making serious money clubbing once a week with your bitches is a must. Bitches need to blow off steam, they love getting dressed up and when you got a big booth in VIP with 4-5 of your bitches and a couple close friends it's a lot easier to pull in high end talent. newlinechar  newlinechar With that being said if you're just starting out and only have one bitch and on a tighter budget, then trying to beat out every other swinging dick in the place puts you at losing odds in the first place. I'd never really try and spit game at a club in any situation though. All I'd do at clubs is follow these simple guidelines... newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Post up and look for eye contact. newlinechar 2. Approach when the time is right. Approach the bitches that are looking at you, not the ones you're trying to force eye contact out of them. If you don't get any looks back on a regular basis it's you, not them. Hit the gym. Buy better clothes. Smile more.  newlinechar 3. Keep game very simple, be polite, introduce yourself. Lots of compliments. Ask them questions. Be sincerely interested. newlinechar 4. When the right song comes on, ask them to dance. Don't treat them like your sister but don't escalate things just yet.  newlinechar 5. Once you've danced for one or two songs unless she is giving you VERY strong signals, end it right now. Tell them you feel a really strong connection with them and you'd like to see them again. Get the number and then give them a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Text her right in front of her to give her your number back.  newlinechar 6. Your work here is done. Leave the club. Again, if she was acting like she wanted more, keep the text conversation going. If you go to another club let her know you left because you had to meet up with some friends. If she keeps texting you, you can head back to the same club where she was at and say you ditched your friends to meet back up with her. If she's not texting you back then don't text her again till the next day. newlinechar  newlinechar At the end of the day that's how it's suppose to work, but a prospect like this will only turn into a money maker I'd say about 1 in 10. You also have your off nights where you don't get any eye contact or when you do, your approach doesn't work. Or when your approach works, you tell them you feel a strong connection and then get a cock blocking best friend come up and steal her away. etc. The point being I don't mean to give anyone the impression that the above is a fool proof system for pulling in bitches every night. It's just what I would do and it worked enough of the time to keep on doing it. newlinechar  newlinechar

Sounds/looks like a possible gas valve or pressure switch issue. newlinechar  newlinechar If it only runs for about 2 mins AND the blower(big motor in the bottom compartment) kicks on at some stage during this then it's unlikely the high limit temp will be reached in this period even with a weak switch. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard to tell but there's a definite and immediate clicking when the flames go out. To me that could be a weak coil in the valve. Although with stuttering flames it could be a pressure issue somewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar Check the rubber hose going to the round metal disc thing in the top left. Make sure it's clear. Does it click at all during the issue? On startup, the small inducer motor (at the top) will run and cause the pressure switch to 'click' once but that's all you should hear. newlinechar  newlinechar Also there may be an error code, if you look at the bottom panel is there a little porthole to look inside? Can you see any LED's? Are they flashing when it locks out?

On days when I wash my scalp I get more tangles than usual. I'm not sure what your hair type is, but after I wash and rinse the conditioner out, I'll add another round of conditioner that I use to detangle, then leave in for a while to absorb into my hair. When I detangle I lean my head to one side so my hair hangs free and start gently detangling from the ends of my hair and work my way up. I gently coax apart the knots and glide my fingers between the strands a little at a time. Then I rinse all the hair out of my hands (yuck, right?) and lean my head to the other side and gently detangle again from the ends and working up. newlinechar  newlinechar I wasn't sure from your OP if you detangle from the ends up or from the roots down, but if you've been working your way down try starting from the ends instead.

THIS is the problem right here. All the medical and recreational laws only allow you to smoke marijuana in the privacy of your own home.

So when you're away from home on any extended stay, you either have to break the law or go without.

My problem is with the notion that fel reaver removes the bottom cards with your deck. It doesn't. If your win condition is at the bottom of your deck, you were gonna lose, REGARDLESS of whether fel reaver is there which is why I don't take that situation into account. newlinechar  newlinechar If your win condition is in your opening hand or before you play fel reaver you probably don't have the good opening any aggro deck NEEDS since your win condition is clogging up your hand. newlinechar  newlinechar If your win condition is right after you play turn 5-7 (since you would rather play sea giant in the late game) then your win condition is gone. newlinechar  newlinechar Tl dr: risking discarding your win condition isn't worth playing fel reaver as you are now hoping that it doesn't lie at the end of your deck OR right after fel reaver but rather in a small gap in between (a gap which is determined by your opponent

In general I agree with the whole 'encourage the trades' thing, but it shouldn't be the only conclusion people draw. My office just hired 3 entry level positions, but they were certainly hoping for a mid-level hire in at least one case. If it's hard to find mid-level positions now, just imagine how it'll be if parents all tell their kids that things like the social sciences are worthless. Unfortunately, this will hurt the more cut off, 'brain drain' areas the most.

If that's the case, she could deny the interview instead of acting like she is reading questions pre-written by Jay's attorney or Urick.

The gist of it is that this guy's horrendous skin bleaching is collectively the fault of every single American because we can't accept black musicians.

Michael Jackson only bleached his skin because America hates black musicians, not due to severe body image issues/psychological reasons.

Well... interestingly, if you have potatoes, then you have sugar. newlinechar  newlinechar A bag of potatoes is essentially just a bag of sugar!  newlinechar  newlinechar That is because potatoes are mostly starch.  newlinechar  newlinechar Starch is a sugar.  newlinechar  newlinechar (Starch is long chain molecular sugar).  newlinechar  newlinechar We don't think of starch as a 'sugar' because it doesn't taste sweet... but this just means that not all sugar is sweet tasting. Some sugars, such as starch, are bland tasting.  newlinechar  newlinechar So the next time your wife/girlfriend sends you out for a bag of sugar, and you come back with a bag of potatoes, then you can, scientifically, argue that you got her precisely what she asked you to get, and that she should have been more specific as to the molecular-length of the particular sugar molecules she was seeking...  newlinechar  newlinechar On second thought, if you want to... you know... later that night... then just get her the sweet tasting sugar!

There are so many families in this city who feel that each and every night. **Is my child safe?...Are they safe from the very people they want to have faith in as their protectors?”** newlinechar  newlinechar Remember that this was in the context of a man being killed accidentally by the NYPD so the implication here is that the mayor of New York City just said that *children* have a reasonable chance of being killed by the NYPD.  newlinechar  newlinechar Out of over 300,000 arrests a grand total of 2 people have been accidentally killed by the NYPD this year.  That means that .00063% of arrests ended up with someone being killed.

What I want to suggest is that we have to consider a person's capacity in order to properly consider their actions praiseworthy or blameworthy.  It would be hard to judge exactly what would count as 'using all of one's capacity to help others'--as you said, one might think that we would have to limit ourselves to fulfillment of our most basic needs in order to be worthy of praise for any charitable actions, which intuitively seems wrong.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think that it is important to recognize the difference in my capacity and  your capacity for assisting the impoverished (etc) compared to the capacity of someone like Gill Bates.  You correctly point out that there is almost certainly more that you and I could be doing.  But there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you and I do not have anywhere near the capacity to make a significant dent in, for example, world hunger.  And if we wanted to try anyway, we would likely have to limit ourselves to bare necessities.  People like Gill Bates, however, have that capacity, and they can do it while continuing to live a more comfortable life than nearly anyone else on the planet.  So I think that the issue has a lot to do with the excess wealth specifically.  But I would be willing to accept that people like you and I are blameworthy to some extent for not doing more--e.g., for not donating more to charity.  However, it would be to a lesser extent than someone like Gill Bates, since Gill Bates's capacity greatly surpasses ours.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: replied before seeing your edit  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit 2 (after having read your edit, and the NYT article): newlinechar  newlinechar I'm inclined to think that the article is right for the most part.  People ought to do more than they are doing.  At the end, they suggested that a person making $50000 has the same obligation as a person making $100000.  They didn't say anything about people making $1-million or $100-million, but presumably they would say that they all should be as close to $30000 as possible.  It seems like it would fit well with that thought, though, that people making $100-million deserve more blame for not limiting themselves to $30000 than people making $50000 do, just in virtue of how much they are missing the target by.  If Person_A makes $1-million each year, and Person_B makes $50000, even if Person_A donates $500000 each year, and Person_B donates $0, Person_A is still missing the target by significantly more than Person_B. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a question for you, though.  Why should charitable contributions not be something we consider when evaluating whether or not a person if worthy of praise or of blame?  In what sense are charitable contributions different from that beach scenario?

Thanks. Sometimes I really let myself down by having a tantrum, and I'm always embarrassed by it. I still have them sometimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example at work the other day something wasn't going right for a client and he had to get on a flight in half an hour. I knew how to fix the problem with his laptop, that he needed for this trip, but I also knew there was a chance it could royally screw everything up. So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving. She says 'NO FOLLOW ME!' and I yelled at her. 'NO I CAN'T, I'M BUSY!!'. I apologized later and told her I was in a very peculiar mood and should never happen. Its just that my dad just drowned a few months ago and I've been at the extremes mood-wise. newlinechar  newlinechar Another dude totally fucked up his order for new employees computers and when they didn't show up, I found that he had ordered only 1 and put in the comments 'I need three of these'. That doesn't work, you need to order 3 systems if you want three. I threw my hands up in the air and scoffed. I realized that was rather rude of me, and again apologized later in the day for my response.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3 years ago my little brother died unexpectedly and 2 weeks later I was with my spouse in the store and we got separated. As I wandered looking for him and his friends in wal-mart. I was getting more and more upset. I was getting so stressed for no good reason (just emotional) and punched a hole in a box of merchandise. Finally found him and started crying that I couldn't find him and I was angry.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know I have problems with my emotions coming out and constantly working on ways to deal with stress. Its a battle I'm winning every day. I really do try.

Considering how old the story is- at least, if the slippers being glass was a feature of the original fairy tale and not just a Disney addition- the glass was probably supposed to signify extravagance and wealth/specialness. Glass wasn't mass produced until the mid-1800s, and though it was available before then, it was still much more valuable than it is today.

There would be no cooked meals without the crew.

Yeah it's around one guy, Shiki Tohno. Very similar in tone. But more girls, their are five heroines. Though I will tell you. It's old. It's still good but it shows it's age. Also I think Shirou is in it. 
I guess we just have to hope that this game will stay forever then. I know some people are against it, but I would enjoy atleast some kind of epilogue of what happens after yamaku or something similar. Doesn't necessarily have to be a whole new game, but still.
Some context is in order. Tumblr made up an imaginary 4chan raid, and ended up thinking that 4chan users were conspiring on omegle in the 4chan tag for who to send hate to. I was talking to a tumblr user.

&gt;It was a thought exercise, not a literal suggestion. newlinechar  newlinechar What is the point of that thought exercise if it has nothing to do with our situation?   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;We may be approaching that state now. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you noticed the price of oil lately? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Without energy, technology and invention do very little. The energy is paramount. newlinechar  newlinechar And without technology, energy does *nothing*. You realize that our entire way of life is dependent on a 1001 factors, such that if one of them 'suddenly disappeared' we'd be in serious trouble.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's certainly possible, but we have a very complex energy infrastructure in place now that needs liquid fossil fuels, and replacing one energy infrastructure with another usually takes decades. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, it will take a long time and be expensive.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This assumes that someone somewhere is designing our economy and infrastructure. newlinechar  newlinechar Not at all. It's a natural reaction to rising oil prices. There has been a massive investment in alternatives over the last decade.  newlinechar

&gt; However, since it has been more than 10 years, he no longer has the rights to that work. So a publisher (or publishers) can release those books again, a movie studio can make a movie from the books and a lot of people can cash in...except for him - the guy that actually wrote the book. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all, there is nothing stopping him from selling his old books just because the copyright has expired. People sell copies of works that are in the public domain every day.  I assume you're familiar with Project Gutenberg. I can freely download all those books, yet many of them are on my shelves today and I paid for them.  Let's say you're a huge fan of this fictional author and you want a copy of one of his old books. You are a fan and want to support him, so why don't you buy it from him directly? He can sell it off his website for next to nothing. He can sign them. He can update them and sell them under a new copyright. He isn't left out of the fun. He can even make movies based on his books (his involvement in a production is going to make it much more appealing to fans). At the same time, others can also sell his books or just throw them up on the internet and let other people read them. In the end, our fictional author gets new fans, more recognition, and more money (from sales of his books both old and new).    newlinechar  newlinechar How is this a bad thing?  newlinechar  newlinechar As for Mr. Martin, he absolutely should lose rights for those first books and if someone comes along and creates (for example) an animated series based on those first books more power to them, and all the better for fans of animation many of which will now run out and start reading the books (including the new ones still under copyright) gaining George even more fans who will gladly fork over their cash for his new works going forward. New art is created. Artists are compensated. Idea's are spread. Everything is good.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I'm pretty sure he's apologized to the guy and keeps in touch with him.  newlinechar  newlinechar He wants a pardon because he wants to become a reserve police officer in California. You can't be a reserve officer in CA with a criminal record.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying what Wahlberg did was right, but he was a teenager for fucks sake. He suffered the consequences of his actions, and if you ask me, he's turned himself around quite a bit. This mentality that people can't change after committing even horrendous acts is ridiculous. I did some fucked up shit as a teenager, and I've since become a much better person than I was back then.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: as /u/BattleCyat pointed out and sourced, the man who was attacked by Mark Wahlberg forgave him and thought he should receive a pardon.
Obvs, but you made the font unnecessarily big so I thought you felt that way. My mistake
Hungarian notation (and abuses thereof) sometimes make sense depending on your environment. I would not, however, consider a database to be such an environment. newlinechar  newlinechar I see no point to it, and it only makes it more time-consuming and annoying for your [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) to map tables to classes.
A word of advice: using the word 'actionable' makes you sound like a fraud.  If you're appealing to your own authority on the grounds that you are a highly educated expert then you shouldn't be using buzzwords. This is one of those times when three words are better than one.

Chromecast would do be fine for this but you can't use the 4od app to stream channel 4, you would have to use a PC for that. You can stream any web page from the chrome/chromium browser on PC so it has that going for it. There's even an experimental feature to stream what's on your desktop as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: not sure about Chromecast working with a VPN as I don't use one, a quick google search will do the trick.

This is a weird meme that has gotten traction in some political circles. No, there was some token assistance from the Chinese, but the Chinese were not huge fans of the Vietnamese. They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive). The soviets were not on much better terms, and between their lack of interest on the one hand and their inability to project geopolitical power outside their near-abroad on the other, they didn't do much. There were some advisors and such on the ground, and that was it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not arguing for leftist agitation. I'm arguing that you should see things as they actually happened. You're not just the good guy shouting at their darkness.

8 years huh, he lived a good life with you it seems. I've read they typically average 5-10 years, with some reaching 15+. He looked like he was in great condition. He had some really nice markings.

No, but the thought of queers stepping up and calling the shots on what queer liberation looks like is apparently threatening to you. We don't exist to make straight people comfortable. If you want us to package everything in a way that isn't uncomfortable to you, then consider the fact that just *existing* as a queer person is discomfort so great, many of us end our lives. Seems a little imbalanced for you to be asking us to be nice-nice when people are dying over this shit.
